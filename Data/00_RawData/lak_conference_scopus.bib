abstract={Collaborative problem solving is defined as having cognitive and social dimensions. While network analytic techniques such as epistemic network analysis (ENA) and social network analysis (SNA) have been successfully used to investigate the patterns of cognitive and social connections that describe CPS, few attempts have been made to combine the two approaches. Building on prior work that used ENA and SNA metrics as independent predictors of collaborative learning, we propose and test the integrated social-epistemic network signature (iSENS), an approach that affords the simultaneous investigation of cognitive and social connections. We tested iSENS on data collected from military teams participating in training scenarios. Our results suggest that (1) these teams are defined by specific patterns of cognitive and social connections, (2) iSENS networks are able to capture these patterns, and (3) iSENS is a better predictor of team outcomes compared to ENA alone, SNA alone, and a non-integrated SENS approach. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper reports on early stages of a machine learning research project, where phases of cognitive presence in MOOC discussions were manually coded in preparation for training automated cognitive classifiers.We present a manual-classification rubric combining Garrison, Anderson and Archer's [11] coding scheme with Park's [25] revised version for a target MOOC. The inter-rater reliability between two raters achieved 95.4% agreement with a Cohen's weighted kappa of 0.96, demonstrating our classification rubric is plausible for the target MOOC dataset. The classification rubric, originally intended for for-credit, undergraduate courses, can be applied to a MOOC context.We found that the main disagreements between two raters lay on adjacent cognitive phases, implying that additional categories may exist between cognitive phases in such MOOC discussion messages. Overall, our results suggest a reliable rubric for classifying cognitive phases in discussion messages of the target MOOC by two raters. This indicates we are in a position to apply machine learning algorithms which can also cater for data with inter-rater disagreements in future automated classification studies. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This study explored data analytic approaches to assessing young children's engagement in robot-mediated collaborative interaction. To develop our analytic models, we took a case-study approach and looked closely into four children's behaviors during three conversational sessions. Grounded in engagement theory, three sources of multimodal behavioral data (utterances, kinesics, and vocie) were coded through human annotation and automatic speech recognition and analysis. Then, information-theoretic methods were used to uncover nonlinear dependencies (called mutual information) among the multimodal behaviors of each child. From this, we derived a model to compute a compound variable of engagement. This computation produced engagement trends of each child, the engagement relationship between two children in a pair, and the engagement relationship with the robot over time. The computed trends corresponded well with the data from human observations. This approach has implications for quantifying engagement from rich and natural multimodal behaviors. &copy; 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Human-centred software design gives all stakeholders an active voice in the design of the systems that they are expected to use. However, this is not yet commonplace in Learning Analytics (LA). Co-design techniques from other domains therefore have much to offer to LA, in principle, but there are few detailed accounts of exactly how such sessions unfold. This paper presents the rationale driving a card-based co-design tool specifically tuned for LA, called LA-DECK. In the context of a pilot study with students, educators, LA researchers and developers, we provide qualitative and quantitative accounts of how participants used the cards. Using three different forms of analysis (transcript-centric design vignettes, card-graphs and time-on-topic), we characterise in what ways the sessions were "participatory" in nature, and argue that the cards succeeded in playing very similar roles to those documented in the literature on successful card-based design tools. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The big data revolution is an exciting opportunity for universities, which typically have rich and complex digital data on their learners. It has motivated many universities around the world to invest in the development and implementation of learning analytics dashboards (LADs). These dashboards commonly make use of interactive visualisation widgets to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about the learning process.Acommon operation in analytical dashboards is a 'drill-down', which in an educational setting allows users to explore the behaviour of sub-populations of learners by progressively adding filters. Nevertheless, drill-down challenges exist, which hamper the most effective use of the data, especially by users without a formal background in data analysis. Accordingly, in this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach that recommends insightful drill-downs to LAD users. We present results from an application of our proposed approach using an existing LAD. A set of insightful drill-down criteria from a course with 875 students are explored and discussed. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Several tools to support learning processes based on educational data have emerged from research on Learning Analytics (LA) in the last few years. These tools aim to support students and instructors in daily activities, and academic managers in making institutional decisions. Although the adoption of LA tools is spreading, the field still needs to deepen the understanding of the contexts where learning takes place, and of the views of the stakeholders involved in implementing and using these tools. In this sense, the SHEILA framework proposes a set of instruments to perform a detailed analysis of the expectations and needs of different stakeholders in higher education institutions, regarding the adoption of LA. Moreover, there is a lacuna in research on stakeholders' expectations from LA outside the Global North. Therefore, this paper reports on the findings of the application of interviews and focus groups, based on the SHEILA framework, with students and teaching staff from a Brazilian public university, to investigate their perceptions of the potential benefits and risks of using LA in higher education in the country. Findings indicate that there is a high interest in using LA for improving the learning experience, in particular, being able to provide personalized feedback, to adapt teaching practices to students' needs, and to make evidence-based pedagogical decisions. From the analysis of these perspectives, we point to opportunities for using LA in Brazilian higher education. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In this paper, we perform a predictive analysis of a curriculumintegrated math game, ST Math, to suggest a partial ordering for the game's curriculum sequence. We analyzed the sequence of ST Math objectives played by elementary school students in 5 U.S. districts and grouped each objective into difficult and easy categories according to how many retries were needed for students to master an objective. We observed that retries on some objectives were high in one district and low in another district where the objectives are played in a different order. Motivated by this observation, we investigated what makes an effective curriculum sequence. To infer a new partially-ordered sequence, we performed an expanded replication study of a novel predictive analysis by a prior study to find predictive relationships between 15 objectives played in different sequences by 3,328 students from 5 districts. Based on the predictive abilities of objectives in these districts, we found 17 suggested objective orderings. After deriving these orderings, we confirmed the validity of the order by evaluating the impact of the suggested sequence on changes in rates of retries and corresponding performance. We observed that when the objectives were played in the suggested sequence, we record a drastic reduction in retries, implying that these objectives are easier for students. This indicates that objectives that come earlier can provide prerequisite knowledge for later objectives. We believe that data-informed sequences, such as the ones we suggest, may improve efficiency of instruction and increase content learning and performance. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The main objective of exams consists in performing an assessment of students' expertise on a specific subject. Such expertise, also referred to as skill or knowledge level, can then be leveraged in different ways (e.g., to assign a grade to the students, to understand whether a student might need some support, etc.). Similarly, the questions appearing in the exams have to be assessed in some way before being used to evaluate students. Standard approaches to questions' assessment are either subjective (e.g., assessment by human experts) or introduce a long delay in the process of question generation (e.g., pretesting with real students). In this work we introduce R2DE (which is a Regressor for Difficulty and Discrimination Estimation), a model capable of assessing newly generated multiple-choice questions by looking at the text of the question and the text of the possible choices. In particular, it can estimate the difficulty and the discrimination of each question, as they are defined in Item Response Theory. We also present the results of extensive experiments we carried out on a real world large scale dataset coming from an e-learning platform, showing that our model can be used to perform an initial assessment of newly created questions and ease some of the problems that arise in question generation. &copy; 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The effectiveness of using learning analytics for learning design primarily depends upon two concepts: grounding and alignment. This is the primary conjecture for the study described in this paper. In our design-based research study, we design, test, and evaluate teacher-facing learning analytics for an online inquiry science unit on global climate change. We design our learning analytics in accordance with a socioconstructivism-based pedagogical framework, called Knowledge Integration, and the principles of learning analytics Implementation Design. Our methodology for the design process draws upon the principle of the Orchestrating for Learning Analytics framework to engage stakeholders (i.e. teachers, researchers, and developers). The resulting learning analytics were aligned to unit activities that engaged students in key aspects of the knowledge integration process. They provided teachers with actionable insight into their students' understanding at critical junctures in the learning process. We demonstrate the efficacy of the learning analytics in supporting the optimization of the unit's learning design. We conclude by synthesizing the principles that guided our design process into a framework for developing and evaluating learning analytics for learning design. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Students' confusion is a barrier for learning, contributing to loss of motivation and to disengagement with course materials. However, detecting students' confusion in large-scale courses is both time and resource intensive. This paper provides a new approach for confusion detection in online forums that is based on harnessing the power of students' self-reported affective states (reported using a set of pre-defined hashtags). It presents a rule for labeling confusion, based on students' hashtags in their posts, that is shown to align with teachers' judgement. We use this labeling rule to inform the design of an automated classifier for confusion detection for the case when there are no self-reported hashtags present in the test set. We demonstrate this approach in a large scale Biology course using the Nota Bene annotation platform. This work lays the foundation to empower teachers with better support tools for detecting and alleviating confusion in online courses. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Confusion has been shown to be prevalent during complex learning and has mixed effects on learning. Whether confusion facilitates or hampers learning may depend on whether it is resolved or not. Confusion resolution, behind which is the resolution of cognitive disequilibrium, requires learners to possess some skills, but it is unclear what these skills are. One possibility may be metacognitive strategies (MS), strategies for regulating cognition. This study examined the relationship between confusion and actions related to MS in Betty's Brain, a computer-based learning environment. The results revealed that MS behavior differed during and outside confusion. However, confusion resolution was not related to MS behavior, and MS did not moderate the effect of confusion on learning. &copy; 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The assessment design community has primarily focused on continuous latent-skill models with strong conditional independence assumptions among knowledge items, while the prerequisite discovery community has developed many models that aim to exploit the interdependence of discrete knowledge items. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by asking, "When does modeling assessment item interdependence improve predictive accuracy?" A novel adaptive testing evaluation framework is introduced that is amenable to techniques from both communities, and an efficient algorithm, Directed Item-Dependence And Confidence Thresholds (DIDACT), is introduced and compared with an Item-Response-Theory based model on several real and synthetic datasets. Experiments suggest that assessments with closely related questions benefit significantly from modeling item interdependence. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={There has been significant efforts in studying collaborative and social learning using aggregate networks. Such efforts have demonstrated the worth of the approach by providing insights about the interactions, student and teacher roles, and predictability of performance. However, using an aggregated network discounts the fine resolution of temporal interactions. By doing so, we might overlook the regularities/irregularities of students' interactions, the process of learning regulation, and how and when different actors influence each other. Thus, compressing a complex temporal process such as learning may be oversimplifying and reductionist. Through a temporal network analysis of 54 students interactions (in total 3134 interactions) in an online medical education course, this study contributes with a methodological approach to building, visualizing and quantitatively analyzing temporal networks, that could help educational practitioners understand important temporal aspects of collaborative learning that might need attention and action. Furthermore, the analysis conducted emphasize the importance of considering the time characteristics of the data that should be used when attempting to, for instance, implement early predictions of performance and early detection of students and groups that need support and attention. © 2020 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={With this work we intend to develop cognitive modules for learning analytics solutions used in inquiry learning environments that can monitor and assess mental abilities involved in self-directed learning activities. We realize this idea by drawing on models from mathematical psychology, which specify assumptions about the human mind algorithmically and thereby automate a theory-driven data analysis. We report a study to exemplify this approach in which N=105 15-year-old high school students perform a self-determined navigation in a taxonomy of dinosaur concepts. We analyze their search and learning traces through the lens of a connectionist network model of working memory (WM). The results are encouraging in three ways. First, the model predicts students' average progress (as well as difficulties) in forming new concepts at high accuracy. Second, a simple (1-parameter) extension, which we derive from a meta-cognitive learning framework, is sufficient to also predict aggregated search patterns. Third, our initial attempt to fit the model to individual data offers some promising results: estimates of a free parameter correlate significantly with a measure of WM capacity. Together, we believe that these results help demonstrate a novel and promising way towards extending learner models by cognitive variables. We also discuss current limitations in the light of our future work on cognitive-computational scaffolding techniques in inquiry learning scenarios. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Until recently an assumption within the predictive modelling community has been that collecting more student data is always better. But in reaction to recent high profile data privacy scandals, many educators, scholars, students and administrators have been questioning the ethics of such a strategy. Suggestions are growing that the minimum amount of data should be collected to aid the function for which a prediction is being made. Yet, machine learning algorithms are primarily judged on metrics derived from prediction accuracy or whether they meet probabilistic criteria for significance. They are not routinely judged on whether they utilize the minimum number of the least sensitive features, preserving what we name here as data collection parsimony. We believe the ability to assess data collection parsimony would be a valuable addition to the suite of evaluations for any prediction strategy and to that end, the following paper provides an introduction to data collection parsimony, describes a novel method for quantifying the concept using empirical Bayes estimates and then tests the metric on real world data. Both theoretical and empirical benefits and limitations of this method are discussed. We conclude that for the purpose of model building this metric is superior to others in several ways, but there are some hurdles to effective implementation. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Asynchronous online discussions are broadly used to support peer interaction in online and hybrid courses. In this paper, we argue that the analysis of online peer interactions would benefit from the focus on relational events that are temporal and occur due to a range of factors. To demonstrate the possibility, we applied Relational Event Modeling (REM) to a dataset from online discussions in seven online classes. Informed by a conceptual model of social interaction in online discussions, this modeling included (a) a learner attribute capturing aspects of temporal participation, (b) social dynamics factors such as preferential attachment and reciprocity, and (c) turnby-turn sequential patterns. Results showed that learner activity and familiarity from recent interactions affected their propensity to form ties. Turn-by-turn sequential patterns, that capture individual posting in bursts, explain how two-star network patterns form. Since two-star network patterns could further facilitate small group formation in the network, we expected the models to also capture communication in triads (i.e. triadic closure). Yet, models, devoid of the content of exchanges, did not capture the social dynamics well, and failed to predict patterns for communication across triads. By bringing in discourse features, future work can investigate the role of knowledge building behaviours in triadic closure of digital networks. This study contributes fresh insights into social interaction in online discussions, calls for attention to micro-level temporal patterns, and motivates future work to scaffold learner participation in similar contexts. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Teachers are increasingly being encouraged to embrace evidencebased practices. Learning analytics (LA) offer great promise in supporting these by providing evidence for teachers and learners to make informed decisions and transform the educational experience. However, LA limitations and their uptake by educators are coming under critical scrutiny. This is in part due to the lack of involvement of teachers and learners in the design of LA tools. In this paper, we propose a human-centred approach to generate understanding of teachers' data needs through the lens of three key principles of translucence: visibility, awareness and accountability. We illustrate our approach through a participatory design sprint to identify how teachers talk about classroom data. We describe teachers' perspectives on the evidence they need for making better-informed decisions and discuss the implications of our approach for the design of human-centred LA in the next years. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In this study, we describe the results of our research to model collaborative problem-solving (CPS) competence based on analytics generated from video data. We have collected ~500 mins video data from 15 groups of 3 students working to solve design problems collaboratively. Initially, with the help of OpenPose, we automatically generated frequency metrics such as the number of the face-in-the-screen; and distance metrics such as the distance between bodies. Based on these metrics, we built decision trees to predict students' listening, watching, making, and speaking behaviours as well as predicting the students' CPS competence. Our results provide useful decision rules mined from analytics of video data which can be used to inform teacher dashboards. Although, the accuracy and recall values of the models built are inferior to previous machine learning work that utilizes multimodal data, the transparent nature of the decision trees provides opportunities for explainable analytics for teachers and learners. This can lead to more agency of teachers and learners, therefore can lead to easier adoption. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the value and limitations of our approach. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

However, despite this recognition, little attention has been paid to the development of tools and strategies with the potential both to foster evaluative judgement and to support empirical research into its growth. This paper provides a demonstration of how educational technologies may be used to fill this gap. In particular, we introduce the adaptive learning system RiPPLE and describe how it aims to (1) develop evaluative judgement in large-class settings through suggested strategies from the literature such as the use of rubrics, exemplars and peer review and (2) enable large empirical studies at low cost to determine the effect-size of such strategies. A case study demonstrating how RiPPLE has been used to achieve these goals in a specific context is presented. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

In online courses, feedback becomes even more critical as it is one of the resources where the teacher interacts directly with the student. However, with the growing number of students enrolled in online learning, it becomes a challenge for instructors to provide good quality feedback that helps the student self-regulate. In this context, this paper proposed a content analysis of feedback text provided by instructors based on different indicators of good feedback. A random forest classifier was trained and evaluated at different feedback levels. The results achieved outcomes up to 87% and 0.39 of accuracy and Cohen's κ, respectively.

abstract={Many factors influence learners' performance on an activity beyond the knowledge required. Learners' on-task effort has been acknowledged for strongly relating to their educational outcomes, reflecting how actively they are engaged in that activity. However, effort is not directly observable. Multimodal data can provide additional insights into the learning processes and may allow for effort estimation. This paper presents an approach for the classification of effort in an adaptive assessment context. Specifically, the behaviour of 32 students was captured during an adaptive self-assessment activity, using logs and physiological data (i.e., eye-tracking, EEG, wristband and facial expressions). We applied k-means to the multimodal data to cluster students' behavioural patterns. Next, we predicted students' effort to complete the upcoming task, based on the discovered behavioural patterns using a combination of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi algorithm. We also compared the results with other state-of-the-art classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest). Our findings provide evidence that HMMs can encode the relationship between effort and behaviour (captured by the multimodal data) in a more efficient way than the other methods. Foremost, a practical implication of the approach is that the derived HMMs also pinpoint the moments to provide preventive/prescriptive feedback to the learners in real-time, by building-upon the relationship between behavioural patterns and the effort the learners are putting in. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Network analysis has become a major approach for analysing social learning, used to capture learner positioning in online forum networks. LA research investigated the association between positioning in forum networks with academic performance and discourse quality, the latter two serving as proxies for learning. However, the research findings have been inconsistent, in part due to the discrepancies in the adopted approaches to network construction. Yet, it is still unclear how online forum networks should be modelled to assure that the learners' network positioning is properly captured. To address this gap, the current study explored if some existing approaches to network construction may complement each other and thus offer richer insights. In particular, we hypothesised that the postreply learner network could represent interpersonal positioning, whereas the network based on co-participation in discussion threads could encapsulate intergroup positioning. The study used learner social interaction data from a large edX MOOC forum to examine the relationship between these two kinds of network positioning. The results suggest that intergroup and interpersonal positioning may capture different aspects of social learning, potentially related to different learning outcomes. We find that although interpersonal and intergroup positioning indicators covary, these measures are not congruent for some 37% of forum posters. Network coevolution analysis also reveals an interdependent relationship between the intergroup and interpersonal centrality in a forum network. Co-occurrence of learners in a discussion thread prior to direct exchanges is predictive of a direct post-reply interaction at a later stage of the course, and vice-versa, suggesting that intergroup positioning is a precursor of direct communication. The study contributes to the discussion around the definition of learner forum positioning in learning analytics, and validated approaches towards measuring it. © 2020 Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={How ideas develop and evolve is a topic of interest for educators. By understanding this process, designers and educators are better able to support and guide collaborative learning activities. This paper presents an application of our Lifespan of an Idea framework to measure engagement patterns among individuals in communal socio-technical spaces like Twitter. We correlated engagement with social participation, enabling the process of idea expression, spread, and evolution. Social participation leads to transmission of ideas from one individual to another and can be gauged in the same way as evaluating diseases. The temporal dynamics of the social participation can be modeled through the lens of epidemiological modeling. To test the plausibility of this framework, we investigated social participation on Twitter using the tweet posting patterns of individuals in three academic conferences and one long term chat space. We used a basic SIR epidemiological model, where the rate parameters were estimated through Euler's solutions to SIR model and non-linear least squares optimization technique. We discuss the differences in the social participation among individuals in these spaces based on their transition behavior into different categories of the SIR model. We also made inferences on how the total lifetime of these different twitter spaces affects the engagement among individuals. We conclude by discussing implications of this study and planned future research of refining the Lifespan of an Idea Framework. &copy; 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Specifically, we conducted an extensive comparison analysis between LAK and EDM from four perspectives, including (i) the topics investigated; (ii) community development; (iii) community diversity; and (iv) research impact. Furthermore, we applied one of the most widelyused language modeling techniques (Word2Vec) to capture words used frequently by researchers to describe future works that can be pursued by building upon suggestions made in the published papers to shed light on potential directions for future research. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have opened new educational possibilities for learners around the world. Most of the research and spotlight has been concentrated on a handful of global, English-language providers, but there are a growing number of regional providers of MOOCS in languages other than English. In this work, we have partnered with thirteen MOOC providers from around the world. We apply a multi-platform approach generating a joint and comparable analysis with data from millions of learners. This allows us to examine learning analytics trends at a macro level across various MOOC providers, with a goal of understanding which MOOC trends are globally universal and which of them are context-dependent. The analysis reports preliminary results on the differences and similarities of trends based on the country of origin, level of education, gender and age of their learners across global and regional MOOC providers. This study exemplifies the potential of macro learning analytics in MOOCs to understand the ecosystem and inform the whole community, while calling for more large scale studies in learning analytics through partnerships among researchers and institutions. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), delivered on platforms such as edX and Coursera, have led to a surge in large-scale learning research. MOOC platforms gather a continuous stream of learner traces, which can amount to several Gigabytes per MOOC, that learning analytics researchers use to conduct exploratory analyses as well as to evaluate deployed interventions. edX has proven to be a popular platform for such experiments, as the data each MOOC generates is easily accessible to the institution running the MOOC. One of the issues researchers face is the preprocessing, cleaning and formatting of those large-scale learner traces. It is a tedious process that requires considerable computational skills. To reduce this burden, a number of tools have been proposed and released with the aim of simplifying this process. Those tools though still have a significant setup cost, are already out-of-date or require already preprocessed data as a starting point. In contrast, in this paper we introduce ELAT, the edX Log file Analysis Tool, which is browser-based (i.e., no setup costs), keeps the data local (i.e., no server is necessary and the privacy-sensitive learner data is not send anywhere) and takes edX data dumps as input. ELAT does not only process the raw data, but also generates semantically meaningful units (learner sessions instead of just click events) that are visualized in various ways (learning paths, forum participation, video watching sequences). We report on two evaluations we conducted: (i) a technological evaluation and a (ii) user study with potential end users of ELAT.

abstract={Time-on-task estimation, measured as the duration between two consecutive clicks using student log-files data, has been one of the most frequently used metrics in learning analytics research. However, the process of handling outliers (i.e., excessively long durations) in time-on-task estimation is under-explored and often not explicitly reported in many studies. One common approach to handle outliers in time-to-task estimation is to 'trim' all durations using a cut-off threshold, such as 60 or 30 minutes. This paper challenges this existing approach by demonstrating that the treatment of outliers in an educational context should be individualspecific, time-specific, and task-specific. In other words, what can be considered as outliers in time-on-task depends on the learning pattern of each student, the stages during the learning process, and the nature of the task involved. The analysis showed that predictive models using time-on-task estimation accounting for individual, time, and task differences could explain 3-4% more variances in academic performance than models using an outlier trimming approach. As an implication, this study provides a theoretically grounded and replicable outlier detection approach for future learning analytics research when using time-on-task estimation. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Our learning path app combines three Personalized Visualizations (PV) that are designed as an external reference to support learners' internal regulation process. The personalized visualizations are based on three pillars: grounding in SRL theory, the usage of trace data and the provision of clear actionable recommendations for learners to improve regulation. This quasi-experimental pre-posttest study finds that learners in the personalized visualization condition improved the regulation of their practice behavior, as indicated by higher accuracy and less complex moment-by-moment learning curves compared to learners in the control group. Learners in the PV condition showed better transfer on learning. Finally, students in the personalized visualizations condition were more likely to under-estimate instead of over-estimate their performance. Overall, these findings indicates that the personalized visualizations improved regulation of practice behavior, transfer of learning and changed the bias in relative monitoring accuracy. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Self-regulated learning (SRL) can predict academic performance. Yet, it is difficult for learners. The ability to self-regulate learning becomes even more important in emerging online learning settings. To support learners in developing their SRL, learning analytics (LA), which can improve learning practice by transforming the ways we support learning, is critical. This scoping review is based on the analysis of 54 papers on LA empirical research for SRL in online learning contexts published between 2011 and 2019. The research question is: What is the current state of the applications of learning analytics to measure and support students'SRL in online learning environments? The focus is on SRL phases, methods, forms of SRL support, evidence for LA and types of online learning settings. Zimmerman's model (2002) was used to examine SRL phases. The evidence about LA was examined in relation to four propositions: whether LA i) improve learning outcomes, ii) improve learning support and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) used ethically. Results showed most studies focused on SRL parts from the forethought and performance phase but much less focus on reflection. We found little evidence for LA that showed i) improvements in learning outcomes (20%), ii) improvements in learning support and teaching (22%). LA was also found iii) not used widely and iv) few studies (15%) approached research ethically. Overall, the findings show LA research was conducted mainly to measure rather than to support SRL. Thus, there is a critical need to exploit the LA support mechanisms further in order to ultimately use them to foster student SRL in online learning environments. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Teachers play an essential role during collaborative learning. To provide effective support, teachers have to be constantly aware of students' activities and make fast decisions about which group to offer support, without disrupting students' collaborative process. Teacher dashboards are visual displays that provide analytics about learners to help teachers increase their awareness of the situation. However, if teachers are not able to efficiently and effectively distill information from the dashboard, the dashboard can become an obstacle instead of an aid. In the present study, we compared dashboards that provide information (mirroring) to dashboards that provide information and alert the teacher to groups that are in need of support (advising). Teachers were shown standardized, fictitious collaborative situations on one of the types of dashboards and were asked to detect the group that was in need of support. Te results showed that teachers in the advising condition more often detected the problematic group, needed less effort to do so, and were more confident of their decisions. Te teacher-dashboard interaction paterns showed that teachers in the advising condition generally started by checking the given alert, but also that they tried to look at as much information about other groups as they could. In the mirroring condition, teachers generally started by examining information from class overviews, but did not always have time to check information for individual groups. Tese findings are discussed in light of the role of a teacher dashboard in teachers' decision making in the context of student collaboration. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This paper presents a study that examined automated cross-language classification of online discussion messages for the levels of cognitive presence, a key construct from the widely used Community of Inquiry (CoI) model of online learning. Specifically, we examined the classification of 1,500 Portuguese language discussion messages using a classifier trained on a corpus of the 1,747 English language discussion messages. In the study, a random forest classifier was developed using a small set of 108 validated indicators of psychological processes, linguistic coherence, and online discussion structure. The classifier obtained 67% accuracy and Cohen's κ of 0.32, showing a moderate level of inter-rater agreement above chance and the general viability of the proposed approach. Most importantly, the findings suggest that certain aspects of cognitive presence construct are highly generalizable and transfer across different languages. Finally, the paper also presents a novel method for addressing class imbalance problem using a generic algorithm heuristic technique, which provided substantial improvements over the use of imbalanced dataset.

abstract={Modelling healthcare providers' knowledge while they are gaining new concepts is an important step towards supporting self-regulated personalised learning at scale. This is especially important if we are to address health workforce skills development and enhance the subsequent quality of care patients receive in the Global South, where a huge skills gap exists. Rich data about healthcare providers' learning can be captured by their responses to close-ended problems within conjunctive solution space -such as clinical training scenarios for emergency care delivery- on smartphone-based learning interventions which are being proposed as a solution for reducing the healthcare skills gap in this context. Together with sequential data detailing a learner's progress while they are solving a learning task, this provides useful insights into their learning behaviour. Predicting learning or forgetting curves from representations of healthcare providers knowledge is a difficult task, but recent promising machine learning advances have produced techniques capable of learning knowledge representations and overcoming this challenge. In this study, we train a Long Short-Term Memory neural network for predicting learners' future performance and forgetting curves by feeding it sequence embeddings of learning task attempts from healthcare providers from Global South. From this training, the model captures nuanced representations of a healthcare provider's clinical knowledge and their patterns of learning behaviours, predicting their future performance with high accuracy. More significantly, by differentiating reduced performance based on spaced learning, the model can help provide timely warning that helps support healthcare providers to reinforce their self-regulated learning while providing a basis for personalised instructional support to aid improved clinical outcomes from their professional practices. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Feedback is a major factor of student success within higher education learning. However, recent changes - such as increased class sizes and socio-economic diversity of the student population - challenged the provision of effective student feedback. Although the use of educational technology for personalised feedback to diverse students has gained traction, the feedback gap still exists: educators wonder which students respond to feedback and which do not. In this study, a set of trackable Call to Action (CTA) links was embedded in two sets of feedback messages focusing on students' time management, with the goal of (1) examining the association between feedback engagement and course success and (2), to predict students' reaction to provided feedback. We also conducted two focus groups to further examine students' perception of provided feedback messages. Our results revealed that early engagement with the feedback was associated with higher chances of succeeding in the course. Likewise, previous engagement with feedback was highly predictive of students' engagement in the future, and also that certain student sub-populations, (e.g., female students), were more likely to engage than others. Such insight enables instructors to ask "why" questions, improve feedback processes and narrow the feedback gap. Practical implications of our findings are further discussed. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The mission of learning analytics (LA) is to improve learner experiences using the insights from digitally collected learner data. While some areas of LA are maturing, this is not consistent across all LA specialisations. For instance, LA for social learning lack validated approaches to account for the effects of cross-course variability in learner behavior. Although the associations between network structure and learning outcomes have been examined in the context of online forums, it remains unclear whether such associations represent bona fide social effects, or merely reflect heterogeneity in individual posting behavior, leading to seemingly complex but artefactual social network structures. We argue that to start addressing this issue, posting activity should be explicitly included and modelled in forum network representations. To gain insight to what extent learner degree and edge weight are merely derivatives of learner activity, we construct random models that control for the level of posting and post properties, such as popularity and thread hierarchy level. Analysis of forum networks in twenty online courses presented in this paper demonstrates that individual posting behavior is highly predictive of both the breadth (degree) and frequency (strength) in forum communication networks. This implies that, in the context of forum-based modelling, degree and frequency may not reflect the social dynamics. However, results suggest that clustering of the network structure is not a derivative of individual posting behaviour. Hence, weighted local clustering coefficient may be a better proxy for social relationships. The empirical results are relevant to scientists interested in social interactions and learner networks in digital learning, and more generally to researchers interested in deriving informative social network models from online forums. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Studying online requires well-developed self-regulated learning skills to properly manage one's learning strategies. Learning analytics research has proposed novel methods for extracting theoretically meaningful learning strategies from trace data originating from formal learning settings (online, blended, or flipped classroom). Thus identified strategies proved to be associated with academic achievement. However, automated extraction of theoretically meaningful learning strategies from trace data in the context of massive open online courses (MOOCs) is still under-explored. Moreover, there is a lacuna in research on the relations between automatically detected strategies and the established psychological constructs. The paper reports on a study that (a) applied a state-of-the-art analytic method that combines process and sequence mining techniques to detect learning strategies from the trace data collected in a MOOC (N=1,397), and (b) explored associations of the detected strategies with academic performance and personality traits (Big Five). Four learning strategies detected with the adopted analytics method were shown to be theoretically interpretable as the wellknown approaches to learning. The results also revealed that the four detected learning strategies were predicted by conscientiousness, emotional instability, and agreeableness and were associated with academic performance. Implications for theoretical validity and practical application of analytics-detected learning strategies are also provided. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Inductive reasoning is an important educational practice but can be difficult for teachers to support in the classroom due to the high level of preparation and classroom time needed to choose the teaching materials that challenge students' current views. Intelligent tutoring systems can potentially facilitate this work for teachers by supporting the automatic adaptation of examples based on a student model of the induction process. However, current models of inductive reasoning usually lack two main characteristics helpful to adaptive learning environments, individual differences of students and tracing of students' learning as they receive feedback. In this paper, we describe a model to predict and simulate inductive reasoning of students for a categorization task. Our approach uses a Bayesian model for describing the reasoning processes of students. This model allows us to predict students' choices in categorization questions by accounting for their feature biases. Using data gathered from 222 students categorizing three topics, we find that our model has a 75% accuracy, which is 10% greater than a baseline model. Our model is a contribution to learning analytics by enabling us to assign different bias profiles to individual students and tracking these profile changes over time through which we can gain a better understanding of students' learning processes. This model may be relevant for systematically analysing students' differences and evolution in inductive reasoning strategies while supporting the design of adaptive inductive learning environments. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={At present, universities collect study-related data about their students. This information can be used to support students at risk of failing their studies. At the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME), Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), the group of the first-year students is the most vulnerable. The most critical part of the first year is the winter exam period when students usually divide into those who will pass and fail. One of the most important abilities, students need to learn, is exam planning, and our research aims at the exploration of the exam strategies of successful students. These strategies can be used for improving first-year students retention. The outgoing research on the analysis of exam strategies of the first-year students in the academic year 2017/2018 is reported. From a total of 361 first-year students, successful students have been selected. The successful student is the one who finished all three mandatory exams before the end of the first exam period. From the exam sequences of 153 selected students, a "layered" Markov chain probabilistic model has been constructed. It uncovered the most common exam strategies taken by those students. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

We report data from a deployment of self-explanation prompts in online programming homework, providing insight into how the frequency of writing explanations is correlated with different variables, such as how early students start homework, whether they got a problem correct, and how proficient they are in the language of instruction. We also report suggestive results from a randomized experiment comparing several methods for increasing the rate at which people write explanations, such as including more than one kind of prompt. These findings provide insight into promising dimensions to explore in understanding how real students may engage with prompts to explain answers. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper describes the analysis of temporal behavior of 11-15 year old students in a heavily instructionally designed adaptive e-learning environment. The e-learning system is designed to support student's acquisition of health literacy. The system adapts text difficulty depending on students' reading competence, grouping students into four competence levels. Content for the four levels of reading competence was created by clinical psychologists, pedagogues and medicine students. The e-learning system consists of an initial reading competence assessment, texts about health issues, and learning tasks related to these texts. The research question we investigate in this work is whether temporal behavior is a differentiator between students despite the system's adaptation to students' reading competence, and despite students having comparatively little freedom of action within the system. Further, we also investigated the correlation of temporal behaviour with performance. Unsupervised clustering clearly separates students into slow and fast students with respect to the time they take to complete tasks. Furthermore, topic completion time is linearly correlated with performance in the tasks. This means that we interpret working slowly in this case as diligence, which leads to more correct answers, even though the level of text difficulty matches student's reading competence. This result also points to the design opportunity to integrate advice on overarching learning strategies, such as working diligently instead of rushing through, into the student's overall learning activity. This can be done either by teachers, or via additional adaptive learning guidance within the system. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Results of a survey filled by 37 teachers in a flipped classroom pedagogy show no consensus over a single organization. A cluster analysis based on teachers' flipped classroom experience allowed us to distinguish two profiles, but they were not associated with any particular question organization preference. Qualitative results suggest the need for different organizations may rely more on a pedagogical philosophy and advocates for differentiated dashboards. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The best performing classifier obtained 0.95 and 0.88 for accuracy and Cohen's kappa, respectively. This paper also provides some theoretical insights into the nature of social presence by looking at the classification features that were most relevant for distinguishing between the different categories. Finally, this study adopted epistemic network analysis to investigate the structural construct validity of the automatic classification approach. Namely, the analysis showed that the epistemic networks produced based on messages manually and automatically coded produced nearly identical results. This finding thus produced evidence of the structural validity of the automatic approach. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

However, studies on predictive learning analytics in the context of blended learning remain relatively scarce compared to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where such applications have gained a strong foothold.

In this work, we explore the log data of a master-level blended course to predict the students' grades based entirely on the data obtained from an online module (a small private online course), using and comparing logistic regression and random forest-based predictive models. The results of the analysis show that, despite the limited data, success vs. fail predictions can be made as early as in the middle of the course. This could be used in the future for timely interventions, both for failure prevention as well as for reinforcing positive learning behaviours of students. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Educational recommender systems (ERSs) aim to adaptively recommend a broad range of personalised resources and activities to students that will most meet their learning needs. Commonly, ERSs operate as a "black box" and give students no insight into the rationale of their choice. Recent contributions from the learning analytics and educational data mining communities have emphasised the importance of transparent, understandable and open learner models (OLMs) that provide insight and enhance learners' understanding of interactions with learning environments. In this paper, we aim to investigate the impact of complementing ERSs with transparent and understandable OLMs that provide justification for their recommendations. We conduct a randomised control trial experiment using an ERS with two interfaces ("Non-Complemented Interface" and "Complemented Interface") to determine the effect of our approach on student engagement and their perception of the effectiveness of the ERS. Overall, our results suggest that complementing an ERS with an OLM can have a positive effect on student engagement and their perception about the effectiveness of the system despite potentially making the system harder to navigate. In some cases, complementing an ERS with an OLM has the negative consequence of decreasing engagement, understandability and sense of fairness. &copy; 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Reading, be it intensive or extensive, is one of the key skills required to master English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. Computerized e-book systems provide convenient access to learning materials inside and outside class. Students may regularly check the meaning of a word or expression using a separate tool to progress on their reading, which is not only disruptive but can lead to other learning problems. An example of a particular issue faced in EFL is when a student learns an inappropriate meaning of a polysemous word for the context in which it is presented. This is also a problem for teachers as they often need to investigate the cause. In this paper, we propose a smart dictionary integrated into an e-book reading platform. It allows the learner to search and note word definitions directly with the purpose of reducing context switching and improve vocabulary retention. Finally, we propose that learner interactions with the system can be analyzed to support EFL teachers in identifying possible problems that arise through dictionary use while reading. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper reports on the findings of a study that proposed a novel learning analytics methodology that combines three complimentary techniques - agglomerative hierarchical clustering, epistemic network analysis, and process mining. The methodology allows for identification and interpretation of self-regulated learning in terms of the use of learning strategies. The main advantage of the new technique over the existing ones is that it combines the time management and learning tactic dimensions of learning strategies, which are typically studied in isolation. The new technique allows for novel insights into learning strategies by studying the frequency of, strength of connections between, and ordering and time of execution of time management and learning tactics. The technique was validated in a study that was conducted on the trace data of first-year undergraduate students who were enrolled into two consecutive offerings (N2017 = 250 and N2018 = 232) of a course at an Australian university. The application of the proposed technique identified four strategy groups derived from three distinct time management tactics and five learning tactics. The tactics and strategies identified with the technique were correlated with academic performance and were interpreted according to the established theories and practices of self-regulated learning. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Problem solving, particularly in disciplines such as genetics, is an essential but difficult competency for students to master. Prior work indicated that trace data can be leveraged to measure the invisible cognitive processes that undergird learning activities such as problem solving. Building on prior work and given the importance and difficulties associated with genetics problem solving, we used unsupervised statistical methods (k-means clustering and feature selection) to characterize the patterns of processes students use during genetics problem solving and the relationship to proximal and distal outcomes. At the level of the individual problem, we found that conclusion processes, such as making claims and eliminating possible solutions, was an important interim step and associated with getting a particular problem correct. Surprisingly, we noted that a different set of processes was associated with course outcomes. Students who performed multiple metacognitive steps (e.g. monitoring, checking, planning) in a row or who engaged in execution steps (e.g. using information, drawing a picture, restating the process) as part of problem solving during the semester performed better on final assessments.We found a third set of practices, making consecutive conclusion processes, metacognitive processes preceding reasoning and reasoning preceding conclusions to be important for success at both the problem level and on final assessments. This suggests that different problem-solving processes are associated with success on different course benchmarks. This work raises provocative questions regarding best practices for teaching problem solving in genetics classrooms. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

However, the ability to translate analytic findings to practice remains problematic. This study aims to address this issue by establishing a model of learner behaviour that is both predictive of student course performance, and easily interpreted by instructors. To achieve this aim, we analysed fine grained trace data (from 3 offerings of an undergraduate online course, N=1068) to establish a comprehensive set of behaviour indicators aligned with the course design. The identified behaviour patterns, which we refer to as observed study strategies, proved to be associated with the student course performance. By examining the observed strategies of high and low performers throughout the course, we identified prototypical pathways associated with course success and failure. The proposed model and approach offers valuable insights for the provision of process-oriented feedback early in the course, and thus can aid learners in developing their capacity to succeed online. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

We measure consistency by using Data Time Warping (DTW) distance for two successive tasks (assignments or discussions), as an appropriate measure to assess similarity of time series, over 11-day timeline starting 10 days before and up to the submission deadline. We found meaningful clusters of students exhibiting similar behavior and we use these to identify three distinct consistency patterns: highly consistent, incrementally consistent, and inconsistent users. We also found evidence of significant associations between these patterns and learner's academic performance. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={A central concern in learning analytics specifically and educational research more generally is the alignment of robust, coherent measures to well-developed conceptual and theoretical frameworks. Capturing and representing processes of learning remains an ongoing challenge in all areas of educational inquiry and presents substantive considerations on the nature of learning, knowledge, and assessment & measurement that have been continuously refined in various areas of education and pedagogical practice. Learning analytics as a still developing method of inquiry has yet to substantively navigate the alignment of measurement, capture, and representation of learning to theoretical frameworks despite being used to identify various practical concerns such as at risk students. This study seeks to address these concerns by comparing behavioral measurements from learning management systems to established measurements of components of learning as understood through self-regulated learning frameworks. Using several prominent and robustly supported self-reported survey measures designed to identify dimensions of self-regulated learning, as well as typical behavioral features extracted from a learning management system, we conducted descriptive and exploratory analyses on the relational structures of these data. With the exception of learners' selfreported time management strategies and level of motivation, the current results indicate that behavioral measures were not well correlated with survey measurements. Possibilities and recommendations for learning analytics as measurements for selfregulated learning are discussed. &copy; 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The temporal and sequential nature of learning is receiving increasing focus in Learning Analytics circles. The desire to embed studies in recognised theories of self-regulated learning (SRL) has led researchers to conceptualise learning as a process that unfolds and changes over time. To that end, a body of research knowledge is growing which states that traditional frequency-based correlational studies are limited in narrative impact. To further explore this, we analysed trace data collected from online activities of a sample of 239 computer engineering undergraduate students enrolled on a course that followed a flipped class-room pedagogy. We employed SRL categorisation of micro-level processes based on a recognised model of learning, and then analysed the data using: 1) simple frequency measures; 2) epistemic network analysis; 3) temporal process mining; and 4) stochastic process mining. We found that a combination of analyses provided us with a richer insight into SRL behaviours than any one single method. We found that better performing learners employed more optimal behaviours in their navigation through the course's learning management system. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

To evaluate different students' experiences with the dashboard, we computed chi-squared tests of independence on dashboard users (52%) to find frequent patterns that discriminate students by their differences in academic achievement and self-regulated learning behaviors. The results revealed discriminating patterns in dashboard use among different levels of academic achievement and self-regulated learning, particularly for low achieving students and high self-regulated learners.

However, our understanding of this complex and dynamic phenomenon is still limited. Here, we examine unimodal primitives (activity on the screen, speech, and body movements), and their multimodal combinations during remote CPS. We analyze two datasets where 116 triads collaboratively engaged in a challenging visual programming task using video conferencing software. We investigate how UI-interactions, behavioral primitives, and multimodal patterns were associated with teams' subjective and objective performance outcomes. We found that idling with limited speech (i.e., silence or backchannel feedback only) and without movement was negatively correlated with task performance and with participants' subjective perceptions of the collaboration. However, being silent and focused during solution execution was positively correlated with task performance. Results illustrate that in some cases, multimodal patterns improved the predictions and improved explanatory power over the unimodal primitives. We discuss how the findings can inform the design of real-time interventions for remote CPS. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Modeling student learning and further predicting the performance is a well-established task in online learning and is crucial to personalized education by recommending different learning resources to different students based on their needs. Interactive online question pools (e.g., educational game platforms), an important component of online education, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, most existing work on student performance prediction targets at online learning platforms with a well-structured curriculum, predefined question order and accurate knowledge tags provided by domain experts. It remains unclear how to conduct student performance prediction in interactive online question pools without such well-organized question orders or knowledge tags by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to boost student performance prediction in interactive online question pools by further considering student interaction features and the similarity between questions. Specifically, we introduce new features (e.g., think time, first attempt, and first drag-and-drop) based on student mouse movement trajectories to delineate students' problem-solving details. In addition, heterogeneous information network is applied to integrating students' historical problem-solving information on similar questions, enhancing student performance predictions on a new question. We evaluate the proposed approach on the dataset from a real-world interactive question pool using four typical machine learning models. The result shows that our approach can achieve a much higher accuracy for student performance prediction in interactive online question pools than the traditional way of only using the statistical features (e.g., students' historical question scores) in various models. We further discuss the performance consistency of our approach across different prediction models and question classes, as well as the importance of the proposed interaction features in detail. &copy; 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={To master a skill, students generally practice the content of the skill in a blocking manner. While practicing in a blocked fashion, students know the context of the problems and also which strategy is needed to arrive at a solution. However, in real life standardized tests, where problems from various skills are grouped together, students often find it challenging to identify the correct strategy to solve the problems. This is because, during learning, students often practice the content in isolation. It hinders their ability to discriminate among the contexts of the problem. In this work, using tutor funtoot, we present students working on the topic Addition Word Problems with a subtraction word problem and investigate how they perform in the out-of-context subtraction word problem. We find that students' performance in the topic Addition Word Problems is a strong predictor of their performance in this out-ofcontext problem. Our results suggest that it is a stronger predictor for higher grades (4th and 5th) compared to the lower (2nd and 3rd ) grades. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Collaborative filtering based algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), tend towards predicting a perpetuation of past observed behavior. In a recommendation context, this can lead to an overly narrow set of suggestions lacking in serendipity and inadvertently placing the user in what is known as a "filter bubble." In this paper, we grapple with the issue of the filter bubble in the context of a course recommendation system in production at a public university. Our approach is to present course results that are novel or unexpected to the student but still relevant to their interests. We build one set of models based on course catalog descriptions (BOW) and another set informed by enrollment histories (course2vec). We compare the performance of these models on off-line validation sets and against the system's existing RNN-based recommendation engine in an online user study of undergraduates (N = 70) who rated their course recommendations along six characteristics related to serendipity. Results of the user study show a dramatic lack of novelty in RNN recommendations and depict the characteristic trade-offs that make serendipity difficult to achieve. While the machine learned course2vec models performed best on off-line validation tasks, it was the simple bag-of-words based recommendations that students rated as more serendipitous. We discuss the role of the kind of information presented by the system in a student's decision to accept a recommendation from either algorithm. &copy; 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The use of computer-based systems in classrooms has provided teachers with new opportunities in delivering content to students, supplementing instruction, and assessing student knowledge and comprehension. Among the largest benefits of these systems is their ability to provide students with feedback on their work and also report student performance and progress to their teacher. While computer-based systems can automatically assess student answers to a range of question types, a limitation faced by many systems is in regard to open-ended problems. Many systems are either unable to provide support for open-ended problems, relying on the teacher to grade them manually, or avoid such question types entirely. Due to recent advancements in natural language processing methods, the automation of essay grading has made notable strides. However, much of this research has pertained to domains outside of mathematics, where the use of open-ended problems can be used by teachers to assess students' understanding of mathematical concepts beyond what is possible on other types of problems. This research explores the viability and challenges of developing automated graders of open-ended student responses in mathematics. We further explore how the scale of available data impacts model performance. Focusing on content delivered through the ASSISTments online learning platform, we present a set of analyses pertaining to the development and evaluation of models to predict teacher-assigned grades for student open responses. &copy; 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Reflection assessment is a critical component of health professions education that can be used for personalized learning support. However, reflection assessment at scale remains a challenge due to the demanding nature of tasks and the common use of simplified criteria of quality. Tis study addressed this issue by developing a multi-dimensional automated assessment that uses linguistic models to classify reflections by overall quality (depth) and the presence of six constituent elements denoting quality (description, analysis, feeling, perspective, evaluation, and outcome). 1500 reflections from 369 dental students were manually coded to establish ground truth. Classifiers for each of the six elements were trained and tested based on linguistic features extracted using the LIWC tool applying both single-label and multi-label classification approaches. Classifiers for depth were built both directly from linguistic features and based on the presence of the six elements. Results showed that linguistic modeling can be used to reliably detect the presence of reflection elements and the level of depth. However, the depth classifier showed a heavy reliance on cognitive elements (description, analysis, and evaluation) rather than the others. Tese findings indicate the feasibility of implementing multidimensional automated assessment in health professions education and the need to reconsider how quality of reflection is conceptualized. © 2020 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Learning analytics promises to support adaptive learning in higher education. However, the associated issues around privacy protection, especially their implications for students as data subjects, has been a hurdle to wide-scale adoption. In light of this, we set out to understand student expectations of privacy issues related to learning analytics and to identify gaps between what students desire and what they expect to happen or choose to do in reality when it comes to privacy protection. To this end, an investigation was carried out in a UK higher education institution using a survey (N=674) and six focus groups (26 students). The study highlight a number of key implications for learning analytics research and practice: (1) purpose, access, and anonymity are key benchmarks of ethics and privacy integrity; (2) transparency and communication are key levers for learning analytics adoption; and (3) information asymmetry can impede active participation of students in learning analytics. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Video is becoming a dominant medium for the delivery of educational material. Despite the widespread use of video for learning, there is still a lack of understanding about how best to help people learn in this medium. This study demonstrates the use of thermal camera as compared to traditional self-reported methods for assessing learners' cognitive load while watching video lectures of different styles. We evaluated our approach in a study with 78 university students viewing two variants of short video lectures on two different topics. To incorporate subjective measures, the students reported on mental effort, interest, prior knowledge, confidence, and challenge. Moreover, through a physical slider device, the students could continuously report on their perceived level of difficulty. Lastly, we used thermal sensor as an additional indicator of students' level of difficulty and associated cognitive load. This was achieved through, continuous real-time monitoring of students by using a thermal imaging camera. This study aims to address the following: firstly, to analyze if video styles differ in terms of the associated cognitive load. Secondly, to assess the effects of cognitive load on learning outcomes; could an increase in the cognitive load be associated with poorer learning outcomes? Third, to see if there is a match between students' perceived difficulty levels and a biological indicator. The results suggest that thermal imaging could be an effective tool to assess learners' cognitive load, and an increased cognitive load could lead to poorer performance. Moreover, in terms of the lecture styles, the animated video lectures appear to be a better tool than the text-only lectures (in the content areas tested here). The results of this study may guide future works on effective video designs, especially those that consider the cognitive load. &copy; 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Online learning environments are now pervasive in higher education. While not exclusively the case, in these environments, there is often modest teacher presence, and students are provided with access to a range of learning, assessment, and support materials. This places pressure on their study skills, including selfregulation. In this context, students may access assessment material without being fully prepared. This may result in limited success and, in turn, raise a significant risk of disengagement. Therefore, if the prediction of students' assessment readiness was possible, it could be used to assist educators or online learning environments to postpone assessment tasks until students were deemed "ready". In this study, we employed a range of machine learning techniques with aggregated and sequential representations of students' behaviour in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), to predict their readiness for assessment tasks. Based on our results, it was possible to successfully predict students' readiness for assessment tasks, particularly if the sequential aspects of behaviour were represented in the model. Additionally, we used sequential pattern mining to investigate which sequences of behaviour differed between high or low level of performance in assessments. We found that a high level of performance had the most sequences related to viewing and reviewing the lecture materials, whereas a low level of performance had the most sequences related to successive failed submissions for an assessment. Based on the findings, implications for supporting specific behaviours to improve learning in online environments are discussed. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Learner-centered pedagogy highlights active learning and formative feedback. Instructors often incentivize learners to engage in such formative assessment activities by crediting their completion and score in the final grade, a pedagogical practice that is very relevant to MOOCs as well. However, previous studies have shown that too many MOOC learners exploit the anonymity to abuse the formative feedback, which is critical in the learning process, to earn points without effort. Unfortunately, limiting feedback and access to decrease cheating is counter-pedagogic and reduces the openness of MOOCs. We aimed to identify and analyze a MOOC assessment strategy that balances this tension between learner-centered pedagogy, incentive design, and reliability of the assessment. In this study, we evaluated an assessment model that MITx Biology introduced in a MOOC to reduce cheating with respect to its effect on two aspects of learner behavior - the amount of cheating and learners' engagement in formative course activities. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, this work provides MOOC designers with an 'analytically-verified' MOOC assessment model to reduce cheating without compromising learner engagement in formative assessments. Second, this study provides a learning analytics methodology to approximate the effect of such an intervention. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Educational tests can be used to estimate pupils' abilities and thereby give an indication of whether their school type is suitable for them. However, tests in education are usually conducted for each content area separately which makes it difficult to combine these results into one single school advice. To help with school advice, we provide a comparison between both domain-specific and domain-agnostic methods for predicting school types. Both use data from a pupil monitoring system in the Netherlands, a system that keeps track of pupils' educational progress over several years by a series of tests measuring multiple skills. A domain-specific item response theory (IRT) model is calibrated from which an ability score is extracted and is subsequently plugged into a multinomial log-linear regression model. Second, we train domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) models. These are a random forest (RF) and a shallow neural network (NN). Furthermore, we apply case weighting to give extra attention to pupils who switched between school types. When considering the performance of all pupils, RFs provided the most accurate predictions followed by NNs and IRT respectively. When only looking at the performance of pupils who switched school type, IRT performed best followed by NNs and RFs. Case weighting proved to provide a major improvement for this group. Lastly, IRT was found to be much easier to explain in comparison to the other models. Thus, while ML provided more accurate results, this comes at the cost of a lower explainability in comparison to IRT. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={With increasing abundance and ubiquity of mobile phones, desktop PCs, and tablets in the last decade, we are seeing students intermixing these modalities to learn and regulate their learning. However, the role of these modalities in educational settings is still largely under-researched. Similarly, little attention has been paid to the research on the extension of learning analytics to analyze the learning processes of students adopting various modalities during a learning activity. Traditionally, research on how modalities affect the way in which activities are completed has mainly relied upon self-reported data or mere counts of access from each modality. We explore the use of technological modalities in regulating learning via learning management systems (LMS) in the context of blended courses. We used data mining techniques to analyze patterns in sequences of actions performed by learners (n = 120) across different modalities in order to identify technological modality profiles of sequences. These profiles were used to detect the technological modality strategies adopted by students. We found a moderate effect size (ϵ2 = 0.12) of students' adopted strategies on the final course grade. Furthermore, when looking specifically at online discussion engagement and performance, students' adopted technological modality strategies explained a large amount of variance (η2 = 0.68) in their engagement and quality of contributions. The result implications and further research are discussed. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

This paper argues that, in a closed-course setting, a time-dependent split into the training set and test set is more appropriate than the usual cross-validation to evaluate the Top-N recommended learning resources at various points in time. Moreover, a new measure is introduced to determine the timeliness deviation between the point in time of an item recommendation and the point in time of the actual access by the user. Different recommender algorithms, including two novel ones, are evaluated with the time-dependent evaluation framework and the results, as well as the appropriateness of the framework, are discussed. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={To scaffold students' investigations of an inquiry-based immersive virtual world for science education without undercutting the affordances an open-ended activity provides, this study explores ways time-stamped log files of groups' actions may enable the automatic generation of formative supports. Groups' logged actions in the virtual world are filtered via principal component analysis to provide a time series trajectory showing the rate of their investigative activities over time. This technique functions well in open-ended environments and examines the entire course of their experience in the virtual world instead of specific subsequences. Groups' trajectories are grouped via k-means clustering to identify different typical pathways taken through the immersive virtual world. These different approaches are then correlated with learning gains across several survey constructs (affective dimensions, ecosystem science content, understanding of causality, and experimental methods) to see how various trends are associated with different outcomes. Differences by teacher and school are explored to see how best to support inclusion and success of a diverse array of learners. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

However, due to the distributed nature of the learning process, analytics need to be combined to offer broader insights into learner's behavior and experiences. Consequently, this paper presents an architecture of a learning ecosystem, that integrates and utilizes cross-platform analytics. The proposed cross-platform architecture has been put into practice via a Java programming course. After a series of studies, a proof of concept was derived that shows how cross-platform analytics amplify the relevant analytics for the learning process.

Inexperienced writers typically overlook revision; when they do revise, they focus on surface errors rather than global revisions that enhance meaning and coherence. Writing analytics can automate personalized prompts to guide revision. We use topic modelling LDA as grounds for an analytic to scaffold holistic revision at paragraph and essay levels. The analytic visualizes topic distribution and generates three types of prompts: Introduction, Paragraph and Conclusion. Feedback encourages revisions focusing on sequencing topics, expanding underdeveloped ideas, and making holistic revisions to improve clarity and coherence of paragraphs. Model feedback was evaluated using undergraduate student essays on various topics scored by human evaluators. Model accuracy was strong for all types of feedback. This opens new branches of research to explore generating personalized feedback at paragraph and essay levels. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Rubrics are widely used throughout postsecondary education as means for aiding in instruction and evaluation. However, despite their broad global adoption, very little is known about the quality of rubrics in use. We develop two measures to assess the quality of rubrics: (1) a checklist identifying criteria of high-quality rubrics based on analytic rubric design best practices and (2) a set of LMS-derived features that are hypothesized to represent structural components that are, in general, necessary but not sufficient for high quality rubrics. The validity of using the feature-generated scores as proxies for identifying rubric quality is evaluated through several means. First, the feature-generated scores are calculated for a set of external exemplary rubrics of known high quality. Second, the feature-scores for a subset of internal rubrics are compared to average human rater scores of rubric quality based on the checklist. We discuss the results, practical applications, and a larger research program surrounding the feature-generated scores. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To further explore gender differences in learners communication behavior and whether it has changed in the context of online synchronous collaboration, we examined students interactions at a sociocognitive level with a methodology called Group Communication Analysis (GCA). We found that there were no significant differences between men and women in the degree of participation. However, women exhibited significantly higher average social impact, responsivity and internal cohesion compared to men. We also compared the proportion of learners interaction profiles, and results suggest that women are more likely to be effective and cohesive communicators.

abstract={A major promise of learning analytics is that through the collection of large amounts of data we can derive insights from authentic learning environments, and impact many learners at scale. However, the context in which the learning occurs is important for educational innovations to impact student learning. In particular, for student-facing learning analytics systems like feedback tools to work effectively, they have to be integrated with pedagogical approaches and the learning design. This paper proposes a conceptual model to strike a balance between the concepts of generalizable scalable support and contextualized specific support by clarifying key elements that help to contextualize student-facing learning analytics tools. We demonstrate an implementation of the model using a writing analytics example, where the features, feedback and learning activities around the automated writing feedback tool are tuned for the pedagogical context and the assessment regime in hand, by co-designing them with the subject experts. The model can be employed for learning analytics to move from generalized support to meaningful contextualized support for enhancing learning. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

One challenge is that it can be difficult to tell if students fail to complete because of disinterest or because of course difficulty.

With these, we find that we can predict a student's next item response with over 88% accuracy. Using these predictions, targeted interventions can be offered to students and targeted improvements can be made to courses. In particular, this approach would allow for gating of content until a student has reasonable likelihood of succeeding. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This paper introduces the Visual Inspection Tool (VIT) which supports researchers in the annotation of multimodal data as well as the processing and exploitation for learning purposes. While most of the existing Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) solutions are tailor-made for specific learning tasks and sensors, the VIT addresses the data annotation for different types of learning tasks that can be captured with a customisable set of sensors in a flexible way. The VIT supports MMLA researchers in 1) triangulating multimodal data with video recordings; 2) segmenting the multimodal data into time-intervals and adding annotations to the time-intervals; 3) downloading the annotated dataset and using it for multimodal data analysis. The VIT is a crucial component that was so far missing in the available tools for MMLA research. By filling this gap we also identified an integrated workflow that characterises current MMLA research. We call this workflow the Multimodal Learning Analytics Pipeline, a toolkit for orchestration, the use and application of various MMLA tools. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Students in the self-regulated learning group are capable of learning without external regulation. In the teacher regulation group students need initial teacher regulation but rely on SRL thereafter. Students in the system regulation group require teacher and system regulation to learn. Finally, the advanced system support group is in need of support beyond the current level of system regulation. Based on these insights, the application of personalized dashboards and hybrid human-system regulation is further specified. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Adaptive educational technologies have the capacity to meet the needs of individual students in theory, but in some cases, the degree of personalization might be less than desired, which could lead to inequitable outcomes for students. In this paper, we use simulations to demonstrate that while knowledge tracing algorithms are substantially more equitable than giving all students the same amount of practice, such algorithms can still be inequitable when they rely on inaccurate models. This can arise as a result of two factors: (1) using student models that are fit to aggregate populations of students, and (2) using student models that make incorrect assumptions about student learning. In particular, we demonstrate that both the Bayesian knowledge tracing algorithm and the N-Consecutive Correct Responses heuristic are susceptible to these concerns, but that knowledge tracing with the additive factor model may be more equitable. The broader message of this paper is that when designing learning analytics algorithms, we need to explicitly consider whether the algorithms act fairly with respect to different populations of students, and if not, how we can make our algorithms more equitable. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The dataset covers not only conventional student information, student questionnaire survey, and university administrative data, but also unconventional data sets such as student location data and learning management system (LMS) log data. Based on the datasets, with respect to 4,000+ freshman students at residential college, we conducted preliminary implementation of descriptive and predictive modeling for student achievement, satisfaction, and mental health. The results were overall promising. First, descriptive and predictive modeling of GPA for student achievement presented a list of significant predictive variables from student locations and LMS activities. Second, descriptive modeling of student satisfaction revealed influential variables such as “improvement of creativity” and “ability of cooperation”. Third, similar descriptive modeling was applied to students' mental health changes by semesters, and the study uncovered influential factors such as “difficulty with relationship” and “time spent with friends increased' as key determinants of student mental health. Although the educational innovation project is still in its early stages, we have three strategies of the future modelling efforts: They are: (1) step-by-step improvement from descriptive, predictive, to prescriptive modelling; (2) full use of recurring data acquisition; (3) different level of segmentation. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

We examine three types of affective transitions based on similarity with the theorized D'Mello and Graesser model, transition between two affective states, and the sustained instances of certain states. We correlate of the frequency of these patterns with learning outcomes and our findings suggest that boredom is a powerful indicator of students' knowledge, but not necessarily indicative of learning.

abstract={Teachers are often encouraged to adopt different positioning strategies at various stages of a classroom lesson as each can influence learners in different ways. However, little work has been done to make evidence of the use of classrooms visible to teachers and students. As sensors drop in price, it is becoming more viable to capture traces of the use of the physical classroom space automatically. In this paper, we build on the notion of spatial pedagogy to propose an approach to visualise digital traces of teacher positioning in the classroom. We illustrate our approach through an authentic case study of a teacher enacting three distinctive learning designs. We document the teacher's and students' reactions to visual representations of positioning data to explore their potential as proxies of spatial pedagogy. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The use of learning trace data together with various analytical methods has proven successful in detecting patterns in learning behaviour, identifying student profiles, and clustering learning resources. However, interpretation of the findings is often difficult and uncertain due to a lack of contextual data (e.g., data on student motivation, emotion or curriculum design). In this study we explored the integration of student self-reports about cognitive load and self-efficacy into the learning process and collection of relevant students' perceptions as learning traces. Our objective was to examine the association of traced measures of relevant learning constructs (cognitive load and self-efficacy) with i) indicators of the students' learning behaviour derived from trace data, and ii) the students' academic performance. The results indicated the presence of association between some indicators of students' engagement with learning activities and traced measures of cognitive load and self-efficacy. Correlational analysis demonstrated significant positive correlation between the students' course performance and traced measures of cognitive load and self-efficacy. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Identifying non-thriving students and intervening to boost them are two processes that recent literature suggests should be more tightly integrated. We perform this integration over six semesters in a First Year Experience (FYE) course with the aim of boosting student success, by using an integrated closed-loop learning analytics scheme that consists of multiple steps broken into three main phases, as follows: Architecting for Collection (steps: design, build, capture), Analyzing for Action (steps: identify, notify, boost), and Assessing for Improvement (steps: evaluate, report). We close the loop by allowing later steps to inform earlier ones in real-time during a semester and iteratively year to year, thereby improving the course from data-driven insights. This process depends on the purposeful design of an integrated learning environment that facilitates data collection, storage, and analysis. Methods for evaluating the effectiveness of our analytics-based student interventions show that our criterion for identifying non-thriving students was satisfactory and that non-thriving students demonstrated more substantial changes from mid-term to final course grades than already-thriving students. Lastly, we make a case for using early performance in the FYE as an indicator of overall performance and retention of first-year students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The effectiveness of learning in massive open online courses (MOOCs) can be significantly enhanced by introducing personalized intervention schemes which rely on building predictive models of student learning behaviors such as some engagement or performance indicators. A major challenge that has to be addressed when building such models is to design handcrafted features that are effective for the prediction task at hand. In this paper, we make the first attempt to solve the feature learning problem by taking the unsupervised learning approach to learn a compact representation of the raw features with a large degree of redundancy. Specifically, in order to capture the underlying learning patterns in the content domain and the temporal nature of the clickstream data, we train a modified auto-encoder (AE) combined with the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to obtain a fixed-length embedding for each input sequence. When compared with the original features, the new features that correspond to the embedding obtained by the modified LSTM-AE are not only more parsimonious but also more discriminative for our prediction task. Using simple supervised learning models, the learned features can improve the prediction accuracy by up to 17% compared with the supervised neural networks and reduce overfitting to the dominant low-performing group of students, specifically in the task of predicting students' performance. Our approach is generic in the sense that it is not restricted to a specific supervised learning model nor a specific prediction task for MOOC learning analytics. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={This study explores the application of computational techniques to extract information about dental students' developing conceptions of their profession from digital reflective journal entries. Top concept networks were created for two cohorts of students at the beginning and end of their four-year program. A shift from a collection of general notions about becoming a professional to a more integrated, patient-centered conceptualization was found for both cohorts. The two groups initially differed in their perception of dental school (a mechanism for being able to work as a dentist versus a place to learn the skills to serve patients well) and subsequently in the extent of attention they paid to the feelings of their patients and themselves, as well as the continual growth of skill after graduation. Several useful linguistic markers were identified for examining these same issues in other cohorts. The results suggest that top concept networks can offer a useful window into students' developing conceptions of their profession. This kind of information can support student success on a macro level by offering feedback on existing curricula / informing learning designs to cultivate desired conceptions, and on a micro level through identifying particular ways individuals align with and diverge from the common trajectories. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are predicated on the notion that access to more academic information can help students regulate their academic behaviors, but what is the association between information seeking preferences and help-seeking practices among college students? If given access to more information, what might college students do with it? We investigated these questions in a series of two studies. Study 1 validates a measure of information-seeking preferences-the Motivated Information-Seeking Questionnaire (MISQ)-using a college student sample drawn from across the country (n = 551). In a second study, we used the MISQ to measure college students' (n=210) performance-avoid (i.e., avoiding seeming incompetent in relation to one's peers) and performance-approach (i.e., wishing to outperform one's peers) information seeking preferences, their help-seeking behaviors, and their ability to comprehend line graphs and bar graphs-two common graphs types for LADs. Results point to a negative relationship between graph comprehension and help-seeking strategies, such as attending office hours, emailing one's professor for help, or visiting a study center-even after controlling for academic performance and demographic characteristics. This suggests that students more capable of readings graphs might not seek help when needed. Further results suggest a positive relationship between performance-approach information-seeking preferences, and how often students compare themselves to their peers. This study contributes to our understanding of the motivational implications of academic data visualizations in academic settings, and increases our knowledge of the way students interpret visualizations. It uncovers tensions between what students want to see, versus what it might be more motivationally appropriate for them to see. Importantly, the MISQ and graph comprehension measure can be used in future studies to better understand the role of students' information seeking tendencies with regard to their interpretation of various kinds of feedback present in LADs. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={It is widely acknowledged that the language we use reflects numerous psychological constructs, including our thoughts, feelings, and desires. Can the so called “noncognitive” traits with known links to success, such as growth mindset, leadership ability, and intrinsic motivation, be similarly revealed through language? We investigated this question by analyzing students' 150-word open-ended descriptions of their own extracurricular activities or work experiences included in their college applications. We used the Common Application-National Student Clearinghouse data set, a six-year longitudinal dataset that includes college application data and graduation outcomes for 278,201 U.S. high-school students. We first developed a coding scheme from a stratified sample of 4,000 essays and used it to code seven traits: growth mindset, perseverance, goal orientation, leadership, psychological connection (intrinsic motivation), self-transcendent (prosocial) purpose, and team orientation, along with earned accolades. Then, we used standard classifiers with bag-of-n-grams as features and deep learning techniques (recurrent neural networks) with word embeddings to automate the coding. The models demonstrated convergent validity with the human coding with AUCs ranging from .770 to .925 and correlations ranging from .418 to .734. There was also evidence of discriminant validity in the pattern of inter-correlations (rs between -.206 to .306) for both human- and model-coded traits. Finally, the models demonstrated incremental predictive validity in predicting six-year graduation outcomes net of sociodemographics, intelligence, academic achievement, and institutional graduation rates. We conclude that language provides a lens into noncognitive traits important for college success, which can be captured with automated methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Randomized experiments ensure robust causal inference that is critical to effective learning analytics research and practice. However, traditional randomized experiments, like A/B tests, are limiting in large scale digital learning environments. While traditional experiments can accurately compare two treatment options, they are less able to inform how to adapt interventions to continually meet learners' diverse needs. In this work, we introduce a trial design for developing adaptive interventions in scaled digital learning environments - the sequential randomized trial (SRT). With the goal of improving learner experience and developing interventions that benefit all learners at all times, SRTs inform how to sequence, time, and personalize interventions. In this paper, we provide an overview of SRTs, and we illustrate the advantages they hold compared to traditional experiments. We describe a novel SRT run in a large scale data science MOOC. The trial results contextualize how learner engagement can be addressed through culturally-targeted reminder emails. We also provide practical advice for researchers who aim to run their own SRTs to develop adaptive interventions in scaled digital learning environments. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Informed by cognitive theories of learning, this work examined how students' self-reported study patterns (spacing vs. cramming) corresponded to their engagement with the Learning Management System (LMS) across two years in a large biology course. We specifically focused on how students accessed non-mandatory resources (lecture videos, lecture slides) and considered whether this pattern differed by underrepresented minority (URM) status. Overall, students who self-reported utilizing spacing strategies throughout the course had higher grades than students who reported cramming throughout the course. When examining LMS engagement, only a small percentage of students accessed the lecture videos and lecture slides. Applying a negative binomial regression model to daily counts of click activities, we also found that students who utilized spacing strategies accessed LMS resources more often but not earlier before major deadlines. Moreover, this finding was not different for underrepresented students. Our results provide some initial evidence showing how spacing behaviors correspond to accessing learning resources. However, given the lack of general engagement with LMS resources, our results underscore the value of encouraging students to utilize these resources when studying course material. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

However, it remains unclear whether LMS activity indeed reflects behavioral properties of student engagement, and it also remains unclear how to deal with variability in LMS usage across a diversity of courses. In this study, we evaluate whether instructors' subjective ratings of their students' engagement are related to features of LMS activity for 9,021 students enrolled in 473 for-credit courses. We find that estimators derived from LMS web logs are closely related to instructor ratings of engagement, however, we also observe that there is not a single generic relationship between activity and engagement, and what constitutes the behavioral components of “engagement” will be contingent on course structure. However, for many of these courses, modeled engagement scores are comparable to instructors' ratings in their sensitivity for predicting academic performance. As long as they are tuned to the differences between courses, activity indices from LMS web logs can provide a valid and useful proxy measure of student engagement. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Using social comparison theory [12], we investigated the influence of ability and opinion-related factors on peer feedback text in a data science MOOC. Perceived SES of peers and the formality of written responses were used as the ability-related factor, while agreement between learners represented the opinion-related factor. We focused on understanding the behaviors of those learners who are most prevalent in MOOCs; those from high socioeconomic countries. Through two studies, we found a strong and repeated influence of agreement on affect and formality in feedback to peers. While a mediation effect of perceived SES was found, a significant effect of formality was not.

abstract={Learning analytics has the potential to detect and explain characteristics of learning strategies through analysis of trace data and communicate the findings via feedback. However, the role of learning analytics-based feedback in selection and regulation of learning strategies is still insufficiently explored and understood. This research aims to examine the sequential and temporal characteristics of learning strategies and investigate their association with feedback. Three years of trace data were collected from online pre-class activities of a flipped classroom, where different types of feedback were employed in each year. Clustering, sequence mining, and process mining were used to detect and interpret learning tactics and strategies. Inferential statistics were used to examine the association of feedback with the learning performance and the detected learning strategies. The results suggest a positive association between the personalised feedback and the effective strategies. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This study examines the extent to which instructions to selfexplain vs. other-explain a text lead readers to produce different forms of explanations. Natural language processing was used to examine the content and characteristics of the explanations produced as a function of instruction condition. Undergraduate students (n = 146) typed either self-explanations or other-explanations while reading a science text. The linguistic properties of these explanations were calculated using three automated text analysis tools. Machine learning classifiers in combination with the features were used to predict instruction condition (i.e., self- or other-explanation). The best machine learning model performed at rates above chance (kappa = .247; accuracy = 63%). Follow-up analyses indicated that students in the self-explanation condition generated explanations that were more cohesive and that contained words that were more related to social order (e.g., ethics). Overall, the results suggest that natural language processing techniques can be used to detect subtle differences in students' processing of complex texts. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Most popular MOOC platforms generate data that can be organized as detailed access trajectories (DATs). We explore the value of DATs by conducting four empirical mini-studies.

abstract={In a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), predictive models of student behavior can support multiple aspects of learning, including instructor feedback and timely intervention. Ongoing courses, when the student outcomes are yet unknown, must rely on models trained from the historical data of previously offered courses. It is possible to transfer models, but they often have poor prediction performance. One reason is features that inadequately represent predictive attributes common to both courses. We present an automated transductive transfer learning approach that addresses this issue. It relies on problem-agnostic, temporal organization of the MOOC clickstream data, where, for each student, for multiple courses, a set of specific MOOC event types is expressed for each time unit. It consists of two alternative transfer methods based on representation learning with auto-encoders: a passive approach using transductive principal component analysis and an active approach that uses a correlation alignment loss term. With these methods, we investigate the transferability of dropout prediction across similar and dissimilar MOOCs and compare with known methods. Results show improved model transferability and suggest that the methods are capable of automatically learning a feature representation that expresses common predictive characteristics of MOOCs. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Student engagement is often considered an overarching construct in educational research and practice. Though frequently employed in the learning analytics literature, engagement has been subjected to a variety of interpretations and there is little consensus regarding the very definition of the construct. This raises grave concerns with regards to construct validity: namely, do these varied metrics measure the same thing? To address such concerns, this paper proposes, quantifies, and validates a model of engagement which is both grounded in the theoretical literature and described by common metrics drawn from the field of learning analytics. To identify a latent variable structure in our data we used exploratory factor analysis and validated the derived model on a separate sub-sample of our data using confirmatory factor analysis. To analyze the associations between our latent variables and student outcomes, a structural equation model was fitted, and the validity of this model across different course settings was assessed using MIMIC modeling. Across different domains, the broad consistency of our model with the theoretical literature suggest a mechanism that may be used to inform both interventions and course design. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Current Learning Analytics (LA) systems are primarily designed with University staff members as the target audience; very few are aimed at students, with almost none being developed with direct student involvement and undertaking a comprehensive evaluation. This paper describes a HEFCE funded project that has employed a variety of methods to engage students in the design, development and evaluation of a student facing LA dashboard. LA was integrated into the delivery of 4 undergraduate modules with 169 student sign-ups. The design of the dashboard uses a novel approach of trying to understand the reasons why students want to study at university and maps their engagement and predicted outcomes to these motivations, with weekly personalised notifications and feedback. Students are also given the choice of how to visualise the data either via a chart-based view or to be represented as themselves. A mixed-methods evaluation has shown that students' feelings of dependability and trust of the underlying analytics and data is variable. However, students were mostly positive about the usability and interface design of the system and almost all students once signed-up did interact with their LA. The majority of students could see how the LA system could support their learning and said that it would influence their behaviour. In some cases, this has had a direct impact on their levels of engagement. The main contribution of this paper is the transparent documentation of a User Centred Design approach that has produced forms of LA representation, recommendation and interaction design that go beyond those used in current similar systems and have been shown to motivate students and impact their learning behaviour. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Massive online courses occupy an important place in the educational landscape of today. We study an approach to scale predictive analytic models derived from online course discussion fora-specifically that of confusion detection-onto other courses. The primary challenge here is the lack of labeled examples in a new course and this calls for unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). As a first step in exploring DA in the education domain, we propose a simple algorithm, DiAd, which adapts a classifier trained on a course with labeled data by selectively choosing instances from a new course (with no labeled data) that are most dissimilar to the course with labeled data and on which the classifier is very confident of classification. Our algorithm is empirically validated on the confusion detection task across multiple online courses. We find that DiAd outperforms other methods on the target domain, while showing a comparable performance to a popular method that uses labeled data from the target domain. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={How do the features of a learning environment's user interface impact learners' agency and, further, their learning? We explored this question in the context of Decimal Point, a digital learning game designed to support middle school students in learning decimals. Previous studies of the game showed that giving students the ability to choose the order and number of mini-games to play did not significantly impact their learning outcomes compared to a condition without choice. In this paper we explore whether some elements of the game's interface may have inadvertently exerted indirect control over students' choice, leading to the previous effects. We conducted a classroom study using a new version of the game that varied whether students saw a visual path connecting mini-games on the game map to modulate the level of indirect control students would experience with an implied ordering. Ultimately, we found that students in the no-line condition exercised significantly more agency but did not learn any less than the line condition. These results suggest that indirect control can be a subtle but powerful way to direct student attention in digital learning games. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={In recent years, several data-driven methods have been developed to help undergraduate students during course selection and sequencing. These methods tend to utilize the whole set of past course registration data, regardless of the past students' graduation GPA and time to degree (TTD). Though some previous work has shown through the results of their developed models that students of different GPA tend to take courses in different sequence, the actual analysis of the degree plans and how/if they relate to the students' graduation GPA and time-to-degree has not received much attention. This study analyzes how the student's academic level when they take different courses, as well as the pairwise degree similarity between pairs of students relate to the students' graduation GPA and TTD. Our study uses a large-scale dataset that contains 25 majors from different colleges at the University of Minnesota and spans 16 years. The analysis shows that TTD is highly correlated with both the timing and ordering of courses that students follow in their degree plans, while the correlation between graduation GPA and the course timing and ordering is not as high. We also perform a case study that uses course timing and ordering features to predict whether the student at each semester will graduate on-time or overtime. The results show that careful curriculum planning is needed to improve graduation rates in universities. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Moreover, it is an attempt to investigate how cognitive load is related to strategy use. Accordingly, in the current study a well- and an ill-structured problem were developed in a virtual learning environment. Online support was provided. Participants were 15 students from the teacher training program. This study incorporated subjective measurements of students' cognitive load (i.e., intrinsic, extraneous, germane load and their mental effort) combined with physiological data containing galvanic skin response (GSR) and skin temperature (ST). A first aim was to investigate whether there was a significant difference for the subjective measurements, physiological data and consultation of support between the well- and ill-structured problem. Secondly this study investigated how individual differences of subjective measurements are related to individual differences of physiological data and consultation of support. Results reveal significant differences for intrinsic load, mental effort between a well- and ill-structured problem. Moreover, when investigating individual differences, findings reveal that GSR might be related to mental effort. Additionally, results indicate that cognitive load influences strategy use. Future research with larger sample sizes should verify these findings in order to have more insight into how we can measure cognitive load and how its related to self-directed learning. These insights should allow us to provide adaptive support in virtual learning environments. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The widespread use of online discussion forums in educational settings provides a rich source of data for researchers interested in how collaboration and interaction can foster effective learning. Such online behaviour can be understood through the Community of Inquiry framework, and the cognitive presence construct in particular can be used to characterise the depth of a student's critical engagement with course material. Automated methods have been developed to support this task, but many studies used small data sets, and there have been few replication studies. In this work, we present findings related to the robustness and generalisability of automated classification methods for detecting cognitive presence in discussion forum transcripts. We closely examined one published state-of-the-art model, comparing different approaches to managing unbalanced classes in the data. By demonstrating how commonly-used data preprocessing practices can lead to over-optimistic results, we contribute to the development of the field so that the results of automated content analysis can be used with confidence. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This paper presents a pilot study that applied unsupervised natural language processing techniques to understand what and how students engage in dialogue in a Teach-Out. We used topic modeling to discover the emerging topics in the discussion forums and evaluated the on-topicness of the discussions (i.e. the degree to which discussions were relevant to the Teach-Out content). We also applied content analysis to investigate the sentiments associated with the discussions. We have taken a step toward extracting structure from students' discussions to understand learning behaviors happen in the discussion forum.

To enable group activities it is not enough to design collaborative tasks and to provide collaboration tools for online scenarios. Collaboration in such learning groups is prone to fail or even not to be initiated without explicit guidance. In the target situations, interventions and guiding mechanisms have to scale with a growing number of course participants. To achieve this under privacy constraints, we aim at identifying target indicators for well-functioning group work that do not rely on any kind of information about individual learners. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={We study the usage of a self-guided online tutoring platform called Algebra Nation, which is widely by middle school and high school students who take the End-of-Course Algebra I exam at the end of the school year. This article aims to study how the platform contributes to increasing students' exam scores by examining users' logs over a three year period. The platform under consideration was used by more than 36,000 students in the first year, to nearly 67,000 by the third year, thus enabling us to examine how usage patterns evolved and influenced students' performance at scale. We first identify which Algebra Nation usage factors in conjunction with math overall preparation and socioeconomic factors contribute to the students' exam performance. Subsequently, we investigate the effect of increased teacher familiarity level with the Algebra Nation on students' scores across different grades through mediation analysis. The results show that the indirect effect of teacher's familiarity with the platform through increasing student's usage dosage is more significant in higher grades. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

We investigate different approaches to analyze user source code submissions in the Python language. We compare the performances of different source code vectorization techniques to predict the correctness of a code submission. In addition, we propose a new mechanism to represent students based on their code submissions for a given set of laboratory tasks on a particular course. This way, we can make deeper recommendations for programming solutions and pathways to support student learning and progression in computer programming modules effectively at a Higher Education Institution. Recent work using Deep Learning tends to work better when more and more data is provided. However, in Learning Analytics, the number of students in a course is an unavoidable limit. Thus we cannot simply generate more data as is done in other domains such as FinTech or Social Network Analysis. Our findings indicate there is a need to learn and develop better mechanisms to extract and learn effective data features from students so as to analyze the students' progression and performance effectively. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Predictive modeling has been a core area of learning analytics research over the past decade, with such models currently deployed in a variety of educational contexts from MOOCs to K-12. However, analyses of the differential effectiveness of these models across demographic, identity, or other groups has been scarce. In this paper, we present a method for evaluating unfairness in predictive student models. We define this in terms of differential accuracy between subgroups, and measure it using a new metric we term the Absolute Between-ROC Area (ABROCA). We demonstrate the proposed method through a gender-based łslicing analysisž using five different models replicated from other works and a dataset of 44 unique MOOCs and over four million learners. Our results demonstrate (1) significant differences in model fairness according to (a) statistical algorithm and (b) feature set used; (2) that the gender imbalance ratio, curricular area, and specific course used for a model all display significant association with the value of the ABROCA statistic; and (3) that there is not evidence of a strict tradeoff between performance and fairness. This work provides a framework for quantifying and understanding how predictive models might inadvertently privilege, or disparately impact, different student subgroups. Furthermore, our results suggest that learning analytics researchers and practitioners can use slicing analysis to improve model fairness without necessarily sacrificing performance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The current study addresses this gap in the literature by experimentally manipulating online display format and social learning settings to understand their influence on student learning and mind-wandering experiences. Results suggest that instructor visibility within an online lecture does not impact students' MW or retention performance. However, we found some evidence that students' social setting during viewing has an impact on MW (p = .05). Specifically, students who watched the lecture in a classroom with others reported significantly more MW than students who watched the lecture alone. Finally, social setting also moderated the negative relationship between MW and material retention. Our results demonstrate that learning experiences during online lectures can vary based on where, and with whom, the lectures are watched. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Here, we build on previous work that indicated that the relationship between response time and student performance is non-linear. Based on this concept, we compare three models: a standard Additive Factors Analysis Model (AFM), an AFM model enhanced with a linear step duration parameter and an AFM model enhanced with a quadratic, step duration parameter. The results of this comparison show that the AFM model that is enhanced with the quadratic step duration parameter outperforms the other models over four different datasets and for most of the metrics we used to evaluate the models in cross validation and prediction. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={A prominent issue faced by the education research community is that of student attrition. While large research efforts have been devoted to studying course-level attrition, widely referred to as dropout, less research has been focused on finer-grained assignment-level attrition commonly observed in K-12 classrooms. This later instantiation of attrition, referred to in this paper as “stopout,” is characterized by students failing to complete their assigned work, but the cause of such behavior are not often known. This becomes a large problem for educators and developers of learning platforms as students who give up on assignments early are missing opportunities to learn and practice the material which may affect future performance on related topics; similarly, it is difficult for researchers to develop, and subsequently difficult for computer-based systems to deploy interventions aimed at promoting productive persistence once a student has ceased interaction with the software. This difficulty highlights the importance to understand and identify early signs of stopout behavior in order to provide aid to students preemptively to promote productive persistence in their learning. While many cases of student stopout may be attributable to gaps in student knowledge and indicative of struggle, student attributes such as grit and persistence may be further affected by other factors. This work focuses on identifying different forms of stopout behavior in the context of middle school math by observing student behaviors at the sub-problem level. We find that students exhibit disproportionate stopout on the first problem of their assignments in comparison to stopout on subsequent problems, identifying a behavior that we call “refusal,” and use the emerging patterns of student activity to better understand the potential causes underlying stopout behavior early in an assignment. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Evidence suggests that individuals are often willing to exchange personal data for (real or perceived) benefits. Such an exchange may be impacted by their trust in a particular context and their (real or perceived) control over their data. Students remain concerned about the scope and detail of surveillance of their learning behavior, their privacy, their control over what data are collected, the purpose of the collection, and the implications of any analysis. Questions arise as to the extent to which students are aware of the benefits and risks inherent in the exchange of their data, and whether they are willing to exchange personal data for more effective and supported learning experiences. This study reports on the views of entry level students at the Open University (OU) in 2018. The primary aim is to explore differences between stated attitudes to privacy and their online behaviors, and whether these same attitudes extend to their university's uses of their (personal) data. The analysis indicates, inter alia, that there is no obvious relationship between how often students are online or their awareness of/concerns about privacy issues in online contexts and what they actually do to protect themselves. Significantly though, the findings indicate that students overwhelmingly have an inherent trust in their university to use their data appropriately and ethically. Based on the findings, we outline a number of issues for consideration by higher education institutions, such as the need for transparency (of purpose and scope), the provision of some element of student control, and an acknowledgment of the exchange value of information in the nexus of the privacy calculus. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Using clustering analysis, we found that non-science majors who performed simple investigations tended to cluster together and biology majors who performed complex investigations also tended to cluster together. We observed two additional clusters that contain both non-science majors and biology majors, but who performed distinct inquiry strategies. This raises some critical questions about how to pedagogically target students within each cluster. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={To support ethical considerations and system integrity in learning analytics, this paper introduces two cases of applying the Value Sensitive Design methodology to learning analytics design. The first study applied two methods of Value Sensitive Design, namely stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool. This investigation uncovered a number of values and value tensions, leading to design trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The second study holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation system for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that included literature analysis, empirical investigations, prototype development, community engagement, iterative testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By reporting on these two cases, this paper responds to a need of practical means to support ethical considerations and human values in learning analytics systems. These two cases demonstrate that Value Sensitive Design could be a viable approach for balancing a wide range of human values, which tend to encompass and surpass ethical issues, in learning analytics design. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

While much progress can be made through detection of local cues in writing, structured prediction approaches offer capabilities that are particularly well tailored to the needs of models aiming to offer substantive feedback on rhetorical structure. We thus cast the analysis of rhetorical structure in academic writing as a structured prediction task in which we employ models that leverage both local and global cues in writing. In particular, this paper presents a hierarchical neural architecture that performs this task. The evaluation demonstrates that the architecture achieves near-human performance while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

abstract={Learning Analytics (LA) studies the learning process in order to optimize learning opportunities for students. Although LA has quickly risen to prominence, there remain questions regarding the impact LA has made to date. To evaluate the extent that LA has impacted our understanding of learning and produced insights that have been translated to mainstream practice or contributed to theory, we reviewed the research published in 2011-2018 LAK conferences and Journal of Learning Analytics. The reviewed studies were coded according to five dimensions: study focus, data types, purpose, institutional setting, and scale of research and implementation. The coding and subsequent epistemic network analysis indicates that while LA research has developed in the areas of focus and sophistication of analyses, the impact on practice, theory and frameworks have been limited. We hypothesize that this finding is due to a continuing predominance of small-scale techno-centric exploratory studies that to date have not fully accounted for the multi-disciplinarity that comprises education. For the field to reach its potential in understanding and optimizing learning and learning environments, there must be a purposeful shift to move from exploratory models to more holistic and integrative systems-level research. This necessitates greater effort applied to understanding the research cycles that emerge when multiple knowledge domains coalesce into new fields of research. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Identifying and monitoring students who are likely to dropout is a vital issue for universities. Early detection allows institutions to intervene, addressing problems and retaining students. Prior research into the early detection of at-risk students has opted for the use of predictive models, but a comprehensive assessment of the suitability of different algorithms and approaches is complicated by the large number of variable features that constitute a student's educational experience. Predictive models vary in terms of their amplitude, temporality and the learning algorithms employed. While amplitude refers to the ability of the model to operate on multiple degrees, temporality is often considered due to the natural temporal aspect of the data. In the absence of a comparative framework of learning algorithms, the aim of this paper has been to provide such an analysis, based on a proposed classification of strategies for predicting dropouts in Higher Education Institutions. Three different student representations are implemented (namely Global Feature-Based, Local Feature-Based, and Time Series) in conjunction with the appropriate learning algorithms for each of them. A description of each approach, as well as its implementation process, are presented in this paper as technical contributions. An experiment based on a dataset of student information from two degrees, namely Business Administration and Architecture, acquired through an automated management system from a university in Brazil is used. Our findings can be summarized as: (i) of the three proposed student representations, the Local Feature-Based was the most suitable approach for predicting dropout. In addition to providing high quality results, the Local Feature-Based representations are simple to build, and the construction of the model is less expensive when compared to more complex ones; (ii) as a conclusion of the results obtained via Local Feature-Based, dropout can be said to be accurately predicted using grades of a few core courses, so there is no need for a complex features extraction process; (iii) considering temporal aspects of the data does not seem to contribute to the prediction performance although it increases computational costs as the model complexity increases. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Currently, college-going students are taking longer to graduate than their parental generations. Further, in the United States, the six-year graduation rate has been 59% for decades. Improving the educational quality by training better-prepared students who can successfully graduate in a timely manner is critical. Accurately predicting students' grades in future courses has attracted much attention as it can help identify at-risk students early so that personalized feedback can be provided to them on time by advisors. Prior research on students' grade prediction include shallow linear models; however, students' learning is a highly complex process that involves the accumulation of knowledge across a sequence of courses that can not be suciently modeled by these linear models. In addition to that, prior approaches focus on prediction accuracy without considering prediction uncertainty, which is essential for advising and decision making. In this work, we present two types of Bayesian deep learning models for grade prediction under a course-specic framework: i)Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and ii) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). These course-specic models are based on the assumption that prior courses can provide students with knowledge for future courses so that grades of prior courses can be used to predict grades in a future course. The MLP ignores the temporal dynamics of students' knowledge evolution. Hence, we propose RNN for students' performance prediction. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, we performed extensive experiments on data collected from a large public university. The experimental results show that the proposed models achieve better performance than prior state-of-the-art approaches. Besides more accurate results, Bayesian deep learning models estimate uncertainty associated with the predictions. We explore how uncertainty estimation can be applied towards developing a reliable educational early warning system. In addition to uncertainty, we also develop an approach to explain the prediction results, which is useful for advisors to provide personalized feedback to students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) are becoming an increasingly popular way to provide students with personalised feedback. Despite the number of LADs being developed, significant research gaps exist around the student perspective, especially how students make sense of graphics provided in LADs, and how they intend to act on the feedback provided therein. This study employed a randomized-controlled trial to examine students' sense-making of LADs showing four different frames of reference, and to what extent the impact of LADs was mediated by baseline self-regulation. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative data analysis, the results revealed rather distinct patterns in students' sense-making across the four LADs. These patterns involved the intersection of visual salience and planned learning actions. However, collectively, across all four LADs a consistent theme emerged around students planned learning actions. This theme was classified as time and study environment management. A key finding of the study is that the use of LADs as a primary feedback process should be personalized and include training and support to aid student sensemaking. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Identifying enrollment patterns associated with course success can help educators design better degree plans, and students make informed decisions about future enrollments. While discriminating pattern mining techniques can be used to address this problem, course enrollment patterns include sequence and quantity (grades) information. None of the existing methods were designed to account for both factors. In this work we present UPM, a Universal discriminating Pattern Mining framework that simultaneously mines various types of enrollment patterns while accounting for sequence and quantity using an expansion-specific approach. Unlike the existing methods, UPM expands a given pattern with an item by finding a minimum-entropy split over the item's quantities. We then use UPM to extract discriminating enrollment patterns from the high and the low performing student groups. These patterns can be utilized by educators for degree planning. To evaluate the quality of the extracted patterns, we adopt a supervised classification approach where we apply various classification techniques to label students according tho their performance based on the extracted patterns. Our evaluation shows that the classification accuracies obtained using the UPM extracted patterns are higher than the accuracies obtained using patterns extracted by other techniques. Accuracy improves significantly for students with larger numbers of patterns. Moreover, expansion-specific quantitative mining leads to more accurate classifications than the methods that do not account for quantities (grades). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) often incorporate lecture-based learning along with lecture notes, textbooks, and videos to students. Moreover, MOOCs also incorporate practice activities and quizzes. Student learning in MOOCs can be tracked and improved using state-of-the-art student modeling. Currently, this means employing conventional student models that are constructed around Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Traditional ITS systems only utilize students performance interactions (quiz, problem-solving or practice activities). Therefore, text interactions are entirely ignored while modeling students performance in MOOCs using these cognitive models. In this work, we propose a Comprehension Factor Analysis model (CFM) for online courses, which integrates student reading interactions in student models to track and predict learning outcomes. Our model evaluation shows that CFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting students' performance in a MOOC. These models can help better student-wise adaptation in the context of MOOCs. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to trace the knowledge of students as they solve a sequence of problems represented by their related skills. This involves abstract concepts of students' states of knowledge and the interactions between those states and skills. Therefore, a KT model is designed to predict whether students will give correct answers and to describe such abstract concepts. However, existing methods either give relatively low prediction accuracy or fail to explain those concepts intuitively. In this paper, we propose a new model called Knowledge Query Network (KQN) to solve these problems. KQN uses neural networks to encode student learning activities into knowledge state and skill vectors, and models the interactions between the two types of vectors with the dot product. Through this, we introduce a novel concept called probabilistic skill similarity that relates the pairwise cosine and Euclidean distances between skill vectors to the odds ratios of the corresponding skills, which makes KQN interpretable and intuitive. On four public datasets, we have carried out experiments to show the following: 1. KQN outperforms all the existing KT models based on prediction accuracy. 2. The interaction between the knowledge state and skills can be visualized for interpretation. 3. Based on probabilistic skill similarity, a skill domain can be analyzed with clustering using the distances between the skill vectors of KQN. 4. For different values of the vector space dimensionality, KQN consistently exhibits high prediction accuracy and a strong positive correlation between the distance matrices of the skill vectors. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

In cycling races, it is crucial not only for athletes to understand their power output but for cycling fans to enjoy the power usage strategy too. However, it is difficult to obtain the power information from each rider due to its competitive sensitivity. This paper discusses a machine learning module that predicts power using the GPS data with the focus on feature design and latency issue. First, the proposed feature design method leverages both hand-crafted feature engineering using physics knowledge and automatic feature generation using autoencoder. Second, the various machine learning models are compared and analyzed with the latency constraints. As a result, our proposed method reduced prediction error by 56.79% compared to the conventional physics model and satisfied the latency requirement. Our module was used during the Tour de France 2017 to indicate an effort index that was shared with fans via media. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={“Not all yards are created equal”. A 3rd and 15, where the running back gains 12 yards is clearly less valuable than a 3rd and 3 where the running back gains 4 yards, even though it will not necessarily show up in the yardage statistics. While this problem has been addressed to some extent with the introduction of expected point models, there is still another inequality omission in the creation of yards and this is the opposing defense. Gaining 6 yards on a 3rd and 5 against the top defense is not the same as gaining 6 yards on a 3rd and 5 against the worst defense. Adjusting these expected points model for opponent strength is thus crucial. In this paper, we develop an optimization framework that allows us to compute offensive and defensive ratings for each NFL team and consequently adjust the expected point values accounting for the opposition faced. Our framework allows for assigning different point values to the offensive and defensive units of the same play, which is the rational thing to do especially in a league with an uneven schedule such as the NFL. The average absolute difference between the raw and adjusted points is 0.07 points/play (p-valueÂ <Â 0.001), while the median discrepancy is 0.06 (p-valueÂ <Â 0.001). This might seem negligible, but with an average of 130 plays per game this translates to approximately 125 points/season discredited. The opponent strength adjustment that we introduce in this work is crucial for obtaining a better evaluation of personnel based on the actual competition they faced. Furthermore, our work allows to evaluate special teams’ performance, a unit that has been identified as crucial for winning but has never been properly evaluated. We firmly believe that our developed framework can make significant strides towards computing an accurate estimate of the true monetary worth of a given player. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Drafting players is crucial for a team’s success. We describe a data-driven interpretable approach for assessing prospects in the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association. Previous approaches have built a predictive model based on player features, or derived performance predictions from comparable players. Our work develops model tree learning, which incorporates strengths of both model-based and cohort-based approaches. A model tree partitions the feature space according to the values or learned thresholds of features. Each leaf node in the tree defines a group of players, with its own regression model. Compared to a single model, the model tree forms an ensemble that increases predictive power. Compared to cohort-based approaches, the groups of comparables are discovered from the data, without requiring a similarity metric. The model tree shows better predictive performance than the actual draft order from teams’ decisions. It can also be used to highlight the strongest points of players. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The classification of trajectory data is required in a wide variety of movement tracking experiments. Automatic classification using machine learning techniques has the potential to greatly increase efficiency and reliability of these studies. Here, we apply supervised classification algorithms on a dataset obtained through a kickboxing experiment to classify the limb and technique that was used for each strike as well as the expertise of the person performing the strike. Beginner and expert kickboxers were asked to strike a boxing bag from several distances, producing a dataset of approximately 4000 strike trajectories. These trajectories were classified using the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) and multi-class linear support vector classification (SVC). We show that both of these algorithms are capable of correctly classifying the limb used for the strike with ∼99% prediction accuracy. Both algorithms could classify the techniques used with ∼86% accuracy. The accuracy of technique classification was improved even further by applying hierarchical classification, classifying techniques separately for each limb. Only 10% of the dataset was required as training set to approach the observed prediction accuracy. Finally, KNN was capable of classifying the strikes by skill level with 73.3% accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of using supervised classification on complex limb trajectory datasets. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

From each soccer situation, we extract spatial relations between the players and a few key locations on the field, which are then hierarchically aggregated within the neural architecture designed to extract possibly complex gameplay patterns stemming from these simple relations.

abstract={Deep learning has started to have an impact on sports analytics. Several papers have applied action-value Q learning to quantify a team’s chance of success, given the current match state. However, the black-box opacity of neural networks prohibits understanding why and when some actions are more valuable than others. This paper applies interpretable Mimic Learning to distill knowledge from the opaque neural net model to a transparent regression tree model. We apply Deep Reinforcement Learning to compute the Q function, and action impact under different game contexts, from 3M play-by-play events in the National Hockey League (NHL). The impact of an action is the change in Q-value due to the action. The play data along with the associated Q functions and impact are fitted by a mimic regression tree. We learn a general mimic regression tree for all players, and player-specific trees. The transparent tree structure facilitates understanding the general action values by feature influence and partial dependence plots, and player’s exceptional characteristics by identifying player-specific relevant state regions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The mean-variance framework by Markowitz is a classical approach to portfolio selection. Earlier work has shown that the basic Markowitz portfolios obtained by solving a quadratic program tend to have poor out-of-sample performance. These issues have been addressed by devising sparse variants of Markowitz portfolios in which the number of active positions is reduced either by applying a no-short-selling constraint or L1-regularisation. In this work we consider a combinatorial approach for finding sparse portfolios, which we call naive k-portfolios, that allocate available capital uniformly on a fixed number of k assets, and only take long positions. We present a novel randomised algorithm, progressive resampling, that efficiently finds such portfolios, and compare this with a number of well-known portfolio selection strategies using public stock price data. We find that naive k-portfolios can be a viable alternative to L1-regularisation when constructing sparse portfolios. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={We propose to represent a return model and risk model in a unified manner with deep learning, which is a representative model that can express a nonlinear relationship. Although deep learning performs quite well, it has significant disadvantages such as a lack of transparency and limitations to the interpretability of the prediction. This is prone to practical problems in terms of accountability. Thus, we construct a multifactor model by using interpretable deep learning. We implement deep learning as a return model to predict stock returns with various factors. Then, we present the application of layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to decompose attributes of the predicted return as a risk model. By applying LRP to an individual stock or a portfolio basis, we can determine which factor contributes to prediction. We call this model a deep factor model. We then perform an empirical analysis on the Japanese stock market and show that our deep factor model has better predictive capability than the traditional linear model or other machine learning methods. In addition, we illustrate which factor contributes to prediction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

In this paper we present two exploratory analyses based on centroid-based clustering that have the goal of understanding the food habits of university students. The first clustering analysis simply exploits the information about the students’ food consumption of specific food categories, while the second exploratory analysis includes the temporal dimension in order to capture the information about when the students consume specific foods.

abstract={Sentiment analysis of Twitter messages is a challenging task because they contain limited contextual information. Despite the popularity and significance of this task for financial institutions, models being used still lack high accuracy. Also, most of these models are not built specifically on stock market data. Therefore, there is still a need for a highly accurate model of sentiment classification that is specifically tuned and trained for stock market data. Facing the lack of a publicly available Twitter dataset that is labeled with positive or negative sentiments, in this paper, we first introduce a dataset of 11,000 stock market tweets. This dataset was labeled manually using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Then, we report a thorough comparison of various neural network models against different baselines. We find that when using a balanced dataset of positive and negative tweets, and a unique pre-processing technique, a shallow CNN achieves the best error rate, while a shallow LSTM, with a higher number of cells, achieves the highest accuracy of 92.7% compared to baseline of 79.9% using SVM. Building on this substantial improvement in the sentiment analysis of stock market tweets, we expect to see a similar improvement in any research that investigates the relationship between social media and various aspects of finance, such as stock market prices, perceived trust in companies, and the assessment of brand value. The dataset and the software are publicly available. In our final analysis, we used the LSTM model to assign sentiment to three years of stock market tweets. Then, we applied Granger Causality in different intervals to sentiments and stock market returns to analyze the impact of social media on stock market and visa versa. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={We present a novel client/vertical-servers architecture for hybrid multi-party classification problem. The model consists of clients whose attributes are distributed on multiple servers and remain secret during training and testing. Our solution builds privacy-preserving random forests and completes them with a special private set intersection protocol that provides a central commodity server with anonymous conditional statistics. Subsequently, the private set intersection protocol can be used to privately classify the queries of new clients using the commodity server’s statistics. The proviso is that the commodity server must not collude with other parties. In cases where this restriction is acceptable, it allows an effective method without computationally expensive public key operations, while it is still secure and avoids precision losses. We report the runtime results on some real-world datasets, and discuss different security aspects and finally give an outlook on further improvements. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={With the rise of new laws around privacy and awareness, explanation of automated decision making becomes increasingly important. Nowadays, machine learning models are used to aid experts in domains such as banking and insurance to find suspicious transactions, approve loans and credit card applications. Companies using such systems have to be able to provide the rationale behind their decisions; blindly relying on the trained model is not sufficient. There are currently a number of methods that provide insights in models and their decisions, but often they are either good at showing global or local behavior. Global behavior is often too complex to visualize or comprehend, so approximations are shown, and visualizing local behavior is often misleading as it is difficult to define what local exactly means (i.e. our methods don’t “know” how easily a feature-value can be changed; which ones are flexible, and which ones are static). We introduce the ICIE framework (Interactive Contextual Interaction Explanations) which enables users to view explanations of individual instances under different contexts. We will see that various contexts for the same case lead to different explanations, revealing different feature interactions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Multivariate time series forecasting involves the learning of historical multivariate information in order to predict the future values of several quantities of interests, accounting for interdependencies among them. In finance, several of this quantities of interests (stock valuations, return, volatility) have been shown to be mutually influencing each other, making the prediction of such quantities a difficult task, especially while dealing with an high number of variables and multiple horizons in the future. Here we propose a machine learning based framework, the DFML, based on the Dynamic Factor Model, to first perform a dimensionality reduction and then perform a multiple step ahead forecasting of a reduced number of components. Finally, the components are transformed again into an high dimensional space, providing the desired forecast. Our results, comparing the DFML with several state of the art techniques from different domanins (PLS, RNN, LSTM, DFM), on both traditional stock markets and cryptocurrencies market and for different families of volatility proxies show that the DFML outperforms the concurrent methods, especially for longer horizons. We conclude by explaining how we wish to further improve the performances of the framework, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={We demonstrate that, by using a small set of hand-graded student work, we can automatically generate rubric criteria with a high degree of validity, and that a predictive model incorporating these rubric criteria is more accurate than a previously reported model. We present this method as one approach to addressing the often challenging problem of grading assignments in programming environments. A classic solution is creating unit-tests that the student-generated program must pass, but the rigid, structured nature of unit-tests is suboptimal for assessing the more open-ended assignments students encounter in introductory programming environments like Alice. Furthermore, the creation of unit-tests requires predicting the various ways a student might correctly solve a problem – a challenging and time-intensive process. The current study proposes an alternative, semi-automated method for generating rubric criteria using low-level data from the Alice programming environment. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Learning analysts often claim to measure learning, but their work has attracted growing concern about whether or not the measures are sufficiently accurate, fair, reliable, and valid, with utility for educators and interpretable by them. This paper considers these issues in the light of practices of scholars in more established fields, educational measurement particularly. The focus is on what really matters about methodologies for measuring learning, including foundational assumptions about the nature of learning, what is understood by the term ‘measured’, the criteria applied when assessing quality of data, the standards of proof required to establish validity, reliability, generalizability, utility and interpretability of findings, and assumptions about learners and learning underlying data modeling techniques used to abstract meaning from the data. This paper argues that, for learning analytics to take its place as a fully-fledged member of the learning sciences, it needs seriously to consider how to measure learning. Methodology crafted at the interface of measurement science and learning analytics May be of sufficient interest to create a new subfield of scholarship – dubbed here ‘metrilytics’ – to make a distinctive contribution to the science of learning. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Acquiring simple arithmetic skills at the preschool level requires repetitive practices. One method for encouraging students to spend longer time practicing is by presenting the skills in an engaging game. As student retention on the game increases, the student will be more likely to acquire the practiced skill since she will have spent more time practicing. In this paper, we examine the relationship between internal locus of control and retention in game-based learning applications for young children using Todo Math, a mobile-based math learning application for children from Pre-K to 2nd grade. We examine 345,783 users’ log data to show that when children prefer “free” mode, which has high internal locus of control, their retention on Todo Math is higher than children who prefer “daily” mode, which has high external locus of control. We present three analyses that support our findings using survival analysis, post-hoc analysis, and t-test. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Analysis processes of learning traces, used to gain important pedagogical insights, are yet to be easily shared and reused. They face what is commonly called a reproducibility crisis. From our observations, we identify two important factors that May be the cause of this crisis: technical constraints due to runnable necessities, and context dependencies. Moreover, the meaning of the reproducibility itself is ambiguous and a source of misunderstanding. In this paper, we present an ontological framework dedicated to taking full advantage of already implemented educational analyses. This framework shifts the actual paradigm of analysis processes by representing them from a narrative point of view, instead of a technical one. This enables a formal description of analysis processes with high-level concepts. We show how this description is performed, and how it can help analysts. The goal is to empower both expert and non-expert analysis stakeholders with the possibility to be involved in the elaboration of analysis processes and their reuse in different contexts, by improving both human and machine understanding of these analyses. This possibility is known as the capitalisation of analysis processes of learning traces. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

From a human-centred computing perspective, the end-user’s interpretation of these visualisations is a critical challenge to design for, with empirical evidence already showing that ‘usable’ visualisations are not necessarily effective from a learning perspective. Since an educator’s interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative about student progress, we draw on the growing body of work on Data Storytelling (DS) as the inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be applied to data visualisations to improve their communicative power. We present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements based on educators’ responses to paper prototypes. The dual purpose is understanding the contribution of each visual element for data storytelling, and the effectiveness of the enhancements when combined. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Capturing students’ behavioral patterns through analysis of sequential interaction logs is an important task in educational data mining and could enable more effective and personalized support during the learning processes. This study aims at discovery and temporal analysis of learners’ study patterns in MOOC assessment periods. We propose two different methods to achieve this goal. First, following a hypothesis-driven approach, we identify learners’ study patterns based on their interaction with lectures and assignments. Through clustering of study pattern sequences, we capture different longitudinal activity profiles among learners and describe their properties. Second, we propose a temporal clustering pipeline for unsupervised discovery of latent patterns in learners’ interaction data. We model and cluster activity sequences at each time step and perform cluster matching to enable tracking learning behaviours over time. Our proposed pipeline is general and applicable in different learning environments such as MOOC and ITS. Moreover, it allows for modeling and temporal analysis of interaction data at different levels of actions granularity and time resolution. We demonstrate the application of this method for detecting latent study patterns in a MOOC course. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Automatic analysis of learners’ questions can be used to improve their level and help teachers in addressing them. We investigated questions (N=6457) asked before the class by 1st year medicine/pharmacy students on an online platform, used by professors to prepare their on-site Q&A session. Our long-term objectives are to help professors in categorizing those questions, and to provide students with feedback on the quality of their questions. To do so, first we manually categorized students’ questions, which led to a taxonomy then used for an automatic annotation of the whole corpus. We identified students’ characteristics from the typology of questions they asked using K-Means algorithm over four courses. The students were clustered by the proportion of each question asked in each dimension of the taxonomy. Then, we characterized the clusters by attributes not used for clustering such as the students’ grade, the attendance, the number and popularity of questions asked. Two similar clusters always appeared: a cluster (A), made of students with grades lower than average, attending less to classes, asking a low number of questions but which are popular; and a cluster (D), made of students with higher grades, high attendance, asking more questions which are less popular. This work demonstrates the validity and the usefulness of our taxonomy, and shows the relevance of this classification to identify different students’ profiles. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Data solutions in the teaching and learning space are in need of pro-active innovations in data management, to ensure that systems for learning analytics can scale up to match the size of datasets now available. Here, we illustrate the scale at which a Learning Management System (LMS) accumulates data, and discuss the barriers to using this data for in-depth analyses. We illustrate the exponential growth of our LMS data to represent a single example dataset, and highlight the broader need for taking a pro-active approach to dimensional modelling in learning analytics, anticipating that common learning analytics questions will be computationally expensive, and that the most useful data structures for learning analytics will not necessarily follow those of the source dataset. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Advisors assist students in developing successful course pathways through the curriculum. The purpose of this project is to augment advisor institutional and tacit knowledge with knowledge from predictive algorithms (i.e., Matrix Factorization and Classifiers) specifically developed to identify risk. We use a participatory action research approach that directly involves key members from both advising and research communities in the assessment and provisioning of information from the predictive analytics. The knowledge gained from predictive algorithms is evaluated using a mixed method approach. We first compare the predictive evaluations with advisors evaluations of student performance in courses and actual outcomes in those courses We next expose and classify advisor knowledge of student risk and identify ways to enhance the value of the prediction model. The results highlight the contribution that this collaborative approach can give to the constructive integration of Learning Analytics in higher education settings. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={It is arguable that the chief aim of Learning Analytics is to use analytics for meaningful purposes in learning and teaching contexts, and that research in the field should advance this cause. However the field does not present a single clear understanding of what constitutes quality in Learning Analytics research. In this paper we present the Pragmatic Inquiry for Learning Analytics Research (PILAR) method as one approach to conducting Learning Analytics research. Rather than creating a new method, we reintroduce an old method to a new field, drawing on the Pragmatic Maxim, proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce as a principle for making ideas clear. Our instantiation of the Pragmatic Maxim requires the researcher to situate Learning Analytics research within a clearly defined learning context and to consider the analytics in terms of the practical effects on learning. We propose three essential elements and a five step process for addressing them in research. After presenting PILAR we address two potential limitations of the approach, and conclude with some implications for its future use in Learning Analytics research. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The results demonstrated that students who processed the information presented in the Exercise View and acted upon it, improved their performance and achieved higher level of success than those who failed to do it.

abstract={Educational environments continue to rapidly evolve to address the needs of diverse, growing student populations, while embracing advances in pedagogy and technology. In this changing landscape ensuring the consistency among the assessments for different offerings of a course (within or across terms), providing meaningful feedback about students’ achievements, and tracking students’ progression over time are all challenging tasks, particularly at scale. Here, a collection of visual Topic Dependency Models (TDMs) is proposed to help address these challenges. It visualises the required topics and their dependencies at a course level (e.g., CS 100) and assessment achievement data at the classroom level (e.g., students in CS 100 Term 1 2016 Section 001) both at one point in time (static) and over time (dynamic). The collection of TDMs share a common, two-weighted graph foundation. An algorithm is presented to create a TDM (static achievement for a cohort). An open-source, proof of concept implementation of the TDMs is under development; the current version is described briefly in terms of its support for visualising existing (historical, test) and synthetic data generated on demand. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Here, we consider a hidden assumption derived from computer science, namely, that improving computational accuracy in classification is always a worthy goal. We demonstrate that this assumption is unlikely to hold in some important educational contexts, and argue that embracing computational “imperfection” can improve outcomes for those scenarios. Specifically, we show that learner-facing approaches aimed at “learning how to learn” require more holistic validation strategies. We consider what information must be provided in order to reasonably evaluate algorithmic tools in LA, to facilitate transparency and realistic performance comparisons. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The cognitive theory underpinning the “testing effect” States that actively recalling information is more effective than passively revisiting materials for storing information in long-term memory. We document the design, deployment, and evaluation of an Adaptive Retrieval Practice System (ARPS) in a MOOC. This push-based system leverages the testing effect to promote learner engagement and achievement by intelligently delivering quiz questions from prior course units to learners throughout the course. We conducted an experiment in which learners were randomized to receive ARPS in a MOOC to track their performance and behavior compared to a control group. In contrast to prior literature, we find no significant effect of retrieval practice in this MOOC environment. In the treatment condition, passing learners engaged more with ARPS but exhibited similar levels of knowledge retention as non-passing learners. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={As Learners move from one learning environment to another, there is a key necessity of taking with them a proof of previous learning achievements or experiences. In most cases, this is either expressed in terms of receipt of scores or a certificate of completion. While this May be sufficient for enrollment and other administrative decisions, it poses some limitations to the depth of learning analytics and consequently a slow onboarding process. Also, with different institutions having their learning data isolated from each other, it becomes more difficult to easily access a learner’s learning history for all learning activities on other systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based approach for connecting learning data across different Learning Management Systems (LMS), Learning Record Stores (LRS), institutions and organizations. Leveraging on unique properties of blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to ensuring learning data consistency, availability, immutability, security, privacy and access control. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The assessment of writing proficiency generally includes analyses of the specific linguistic and rhetorical features contained in the singular essays produced by students. However, researchers have recently proposed that an individual’s ability to flexibly adapt the linguistic properties of their writing might more closely capture writing skill. However, the features of the task, learner, and educational context that influence this flexibility remain largely unknown. The current study extends this research by examining relations between linguistic flexibility, reading comprehension ability, and feedback in the context of an automated writing evaluation system. Students (n = 131) wrote and revised six essays in an automated writing evaluation system and were provided both summative and formative feedback on their writing. Additionally, half of the students had access to a spelling and grammar checker that provided lower-level feedback during the writing period. The results provide evidence for the fact that developing writers demonstrate linguistic flexibility across the essays that they produce. However, analyses also indicate that lower-level feedback (i.e., spelling and grammar feedback) have little to no impact on the properties of students’ essays nor on their variability across prompts or drafts. Overall, the current study provides important insights into the role of flexibility in writing skill and develops a strong foundation on which to conduct future research and educational interventions. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Student success, a major focus in higher education, in part, requires students to remain actively engaged in the required coursework. Identifying student disengagement, when a student stops completing coursework, at scale has been a continuing challenge for higher education due to the heterogeneity of traditional college courses. This research uses data from Connect by McGraw-Hill Education, a widely used online learning tool, to build a classifier to identify learning tool disengagement at scale. This classifier was trained and tested on four years of historical data, representing 4.5 million students in 175,000 courses, across 256 disciplines. Results show that the classifier is effective in identifying disengagement within the online learning tool against baselines, across time, and within and across disciplines. The classifier was also effective in identifying students at risk of disengaging from Connect and then earning unsuccessful grades in a pilot course for which the assignments in Connect were worth a relatively small portion of the overall course grade. Because Connect is widely used, this classifier is positioned to be a good tool for instructors and institutions to identify students at risk for disengagement from coursework. Instructors and institutions can use this information to design and implement interventions to improve engagement and improve student success at the institution in key courses. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

In order to address the real-world challenges of progressing teachers’ efficacy and capacity toward analytics-enabled teaching as design, we have placed the teacher – as a cognitive, social, and emotional being – at the center. In so doing, we discuss potential directions towards research for practice in elucidating underpinning factors of teacher inquiry in the process of authentic design. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

To design these analytics, we conducted a field study analyzing essay samples from immigrant adult ELLs (a group often overlooked in writing analytics research) and identifying their epistemic beliefs and learning motivations. We identified common themes across individual learner differences and patterns of errors in the writing samples. The study revealed strong associations between epistemic writing beliefs and learning strategies.

abstract={Our work focuses on a multi-institutional implementation and evaluation of a Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) at scale, providing feedback to N=337 aspiring STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) students participating in a region-wide positioning test before entering the study program. Study advisors were closely involved in the design and evaluation of the dashboard. The multi-institutional context of our case study requires careful consideration of external stakeholders and data ownership and portability issues, which gives shape to the technical design of the LAD. Our approach confirms students as active agents with data ownership, using an anonymous feedback code to access the LAD and to enable students to share their data with institutions at their discretion. Other distinguishing features of the LAD are the support for active content contribution by study advisors and LATEX typesetting of question item feedback to enhance visual recognizability. We present our lessons learnt from a first iteration in production. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In this paper we explore the potential role, value and utility of a personal code of ethics (COE) for learning analytics practitioners, and in particular we consider whether such a COE might usefully mediate individual actions and choices in relation to a more abstract institutional COE. While several institutional COEs now exist, little attention has been paid to detailing the ethical responsibilities of individual practitioners. To investigate the problems associated with developing and implementing a personal COE, we drafted an LA Practitioner COE based on other professional codes, and invited feedback from a range of learning analytics stakeholders and practitioners: ethicists, students, researchers and technology executives. Three main themes emerged from their reflections: 1. A need to balance real world demands with abstract principles, 2. The limits to individual accountability within the learning analytics space, and 3. The continuing value of debate around an aspirational code of ethics within the field of learning analytics. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Previous studies have investigated the relationship between affect, behavior, and learning in blended learning systems. These articles have found that affect and behavior are closely linked with learning outcomes. In this paper, we attempt to replicate prior work on how affective States and behaviors relate to mathematics achievement, investigating these issues within the context of 5th-grade students in South Texas using a mathematics blended learning system, Reasoning Mind. We use automatic detectors of student behavior and affect, and correlate inferred rates of each behavior and affective state with the students' end-of-year standardized assessment score. A positive correlation between engaged concentration and test scores replicates previous studies, as does a negative correlation between boredom and test scores. However, our findings differ from previous findings relating to confusion, frustration, and off-task behavior, suggesting the importance of contextual factors for the relationship between behavior, affect, and learning. Our study represents a step in understanding how broadly findings on the relationships between affect/behavior and learning generalize across different learning platforms. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Despite this interest in learning at scale, limited work has compared MOOC activity across subsequent course offerings. In this study, we explore forum activity in ten iterations of the same MOOC. Our results suggest that participation in MOOC forums has changed over the past four years of delivery. First, overall participation in MOOC forums have decreased. Second, in later iterations cohorts of more committed forum users start to resemble formal online courses in size (67>n>36). However, despite the smaller groups of learners that should find it easier to form connections with one another, our analysis did not reveal the expected increase in the quality of social activity. Instead, MOOC forums evolved into smaller on-task question and answer (Q&A) spaces, not capitalizing on the opportunities for social learning. We discuss practical and research implications of such changes. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Learning analytics can bridge the gap between learning sciences and data analytics, leveraging the expertise of both fields in exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper presents an evaluation of a learning dashboard that supports the dialogue between a student and a study advisor. The dashboard was designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers. To ensure scalability to other contexts, the dashboard uses data that is commonly available at any higher education institute. It visualizes the grades of the student, an overview of the progress through the year, his/her position in comparison with peers, sliders to plan the next years and a prediction of the length of the bachelor program for this student in years based on historic data. The dashboard was deployed at KU Leuven, Belgium and used in September 2017 to support 224 sessions between students and study advisers. We observed twenty of these conversations. We also collected feedback from 101 students with questionnaires. Results of our observations indicate that the dashboard primarily triggers insights at the beginning of a conversation. The number of insights and the level of these insights (factual, interpretative and reflective) depends on the context of the conversation. Most insights were triggered in conversations with students doubting to continue the program, indicating that our dashboard is useful to support difficult decision-making processes. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Addressing assessment validity and more specifically competency frameworks mapping adequacy, we propose a rule-based tool to ease the building and the refinement of CBE courses and curricula. After introducing the context and briefly the related work, we present our set of rules before illustrating the capacity of the proposed diagnostic tool on an engineering curriculum. Experiments show that this tool can improve mapping adequacy in term of predictive accuracy and would require more efforts towards competency parameters reliability measurement. © 2018 Crown in Right of Canada.},

abstract={Research has revealed that the design of online learning environments can influence students’ use and performance. In this study, an online learning environment for learning French as a foreign language was developed in line with the four component instructional design (4C/ID) model. While the 4C/ID-model is a well-established instructional design model, little is known about (1) factors impacting students’ use of the four components, namely, learning tasks, part-task practice, supportive and procedural information during their learning process as well as about (2) the way in which students’ differences in use of the 4C/ID-based online learning environment impacts course performance. The aim of this study is, therefore, twofold. Firstly, it investigates the influence of students’ prior knowledge, task value and self-efficacy on students’ use of the four different components of the 4C/ID-model. Secondly, it examines the influence of students’ use of the components on their learning gain, taking into account their characteristics. The sample consisted of 161 students in higher education. Results, based on structural equation modelling (SEM), indicate that prior knowledge has a negative influence on students’ use of learning tasks and part-task practice. Task value has a positive influence on use of learning tasks and supportive information. Additionally, results indicate that use of use of learning tasks, procedural information, controlled for students’ prior knowledge significantly contribute to students’ learning gain. Results suggest that students’ use of the four components is based on their cognitive and motivational characteristics. Furthermore, results reveal the impact of students’ use of learning tasks and procedural information on students’ learning gain. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Larger student intakes by universities and the rise of education through Massive Open Online Courses has led to less direct contact time with teaching staff for each student. One potential way of addressing this contact deficit is to invite learners to engage in peer learning and peer support; however, without technological support they May be unable to discover suitable peer connections that can enhance their learning experience. Two different research subfields with ties to recommender systems provide partial solutions to this problem. Reciprocal recommender systems provide sophisticated filtering techniques that enable users to connect with one another. To date, however, the main focus of reciprocal recommender systems has been on providing recommendation in online dating sites. Recommender systems for technology enhanced learning have employed and tailored exemplary recommenders towards use in education, with a focus on recommending learning content rather than other users. In this paper, we first discuss the importance of supporting peer learning and the role recommending reciprocal peers can play in educational settings. We then introduce our open-source course-level recommendation platform called RiPPLE that has the capacity to provide reciprocal peer recommendation. The proposed reciprocal peer recommender algorithm is evaluated against key criteria such as scalability, reciprocality, coverage, and quality and shows improvement over a baseline recommender. Primary results indicate that the system can help learners connect with peers based on their knowledge gaps and reciprocal preferences, with designed flexibility to address key limitations of existing algorithms identified in the literature. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Despite strong interest in learning analytics (LA), adoption at a large-scale organizational level continues to be problematic. This May in part be due to the lack of acknowledgement of existing conceptual LA models to operationalize how key adoption dimensions interact to inform the realities of the implementation process. This paper proposes the framing of LA adoption in complexity leadership theory (CLT) to study the overarching system dynamics. The framing is empirically validated in a study analysing interviews with senior staff in Australian universities (n=32). The results were coded for several adoption dimensions including leadership, governance, staff development, and culture. The coded data were then analysed with latent class analysis. The results identified two classes of universities that either i) followed an instrumental approach to adoption - typically top-down leadership, large scale project with high technology focus yet demonstrating limited staff uptake; or ii) were characterized as emergent innovators –bottom up, strong consultation process, but with subsequent challenges in communicating and scaling up innovations. The results suggest there is a need to broaden the focus of research in LA adoption models to move on from small-scale course/program levels to a more holistic and complex organizational level. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Video analysis is a staple of the education research community. For many contemporary education researchers, participation in the video coding process serves as a rite of passage. However, recent developments in multimodal learning analytics May help to accelerate and enhance this process by providing researchers with a more nuanced glimpse into a set of learning experiences. As an example of how to use multimodal learning analytics towards these ends, this paper includes a preliminary analysis from 54 college students, who completed two engineering design tasks in pairs. Gesture, speech and electro-dermal activation data were collected as students completed these tasks. The gesture data was used to learn a set of canonical clusters (N=4). A decision tree was trained based on individual students’ cluster frequencies, and pre-post learning gains. The nodes in the decision tree were then used to identify a subset of video segments that were human coded based on prior work in learning analytics and engineering design. The combination of machine learning and human inference helps elucidate the practices that seem to correlate with student learning. In particular, both engagement and disengagement seem to correlate with student learning, albeit in a somewhat nuanced fashion. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In blended learning scenarios, evidence needs to be gathered from digital and physical spaces to obtain a more complete view of the teaching and learning processes. However, these scenarios are highly heterogeneous, and the varying data sources available in each particular context can condition the accuracy, relevance, in-terpretability and actionability of the Learning Analytics (LA) solutions, affecting also the user’s sense of agency and trust in such solutions. To aid stakeholders in making use of learning analytics, we propose a process to involve teachers in customizing multimodal LA (MMLA) solutions, adapting them to their particular blended learning situation (e.g., identifying relevant data sources and metrics). Since measuring the added value of adopting an LA solution is not straightforward, we also propose a concrete method for doing so. The results obtained from two case studies in authentic, blended computer-supported collaborative learning settings show an improvement in the sensitivity and F1 scores of the customized MMLA solution. Aside from these quantitative improvements, participant teachers reported both an increment in the effort involved, but also increased relevance, understanding and actionability of the results. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This paper reports a Design-Based Research project developing a tool (the Process Tab) that supports teachers’ interventions with students in virtual internships. The tool uses a networked approach and allows insights into the discourse of groups and individuals based on contributions in chat fora and assignments. In the paper, we present the tool and reports from interviews with three teachers who used the tool. The interviews provide insights about the teachers’ hopes, actual use, and difficulties with the tool. The main insight is that even though the teachers genuinely liked the idea and specific representations of the Process Tab, their lack of ability to teach and look at the tool at the same time hindered their use. In the final part of the paper, we discuss how to address this issue. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={When used in classrooms, personalized learning software allows students to work at their own pace, while freeing up the teacher to spend more time working one-on-one with students. Yet such personalized classrooms also pose unique challenges for teachers, who are tasked with monitoring classes working on divergent activities, and prioritizing help-giving in the face of limited time. This paper reports on the co-design, implementation, and evaluation of a wearable classroom orchestration tool for K-12 teachers: mixed-reality smart glasses that augment teachers’ real-time perceptions of their students’ learning, metacognition, and behavior, while students work with personalized learning software. The main contributions are: (1) the first exploration of the use of smart glasses to support orchestration of personalized classrooms, yielding design findings that May inform future work on real-time orchestration tools; (2) Replay Enactments: a new prototyping method for real-time orchestration tools; and (3) an in-lab evaluation and classroom pilot using a prototype of teacher smart glasses (Lumilo), with early findings suggesting that Lumilo can direct teachers’ time to students who May need it most. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Videos are often the core content in open online education, such as in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Students spend most of their time in a MOOC on watching educational videos. However, merely watching a video is a relatively passive learning activity. To increase the educational benefits of online videos, students could benefit from more actively interacting with the to-be-learned material. In this paper two studies (n = 13k) are presented which examined the educational benefits of two more active learning strategies: 1) Retrieval Practice tasks which asked students to shortly summarize the content of videos, and 2) Given Summary tasks in which the students were asked to read pre-written summaries of videos. Writing, as well as reading summaries of videos were positively related to quiz grades. Both interventions seemed to help students to perform better, but there was no apparent difference between the efficacy of these interventions. These studies show how the quality of online education can be improved by adapting course design to established approaches from the learning sciences. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Self-explanations are commonly used to assess on-line reading comprehension processes. However, traditional methods of analysis ignore important temporal variations in these explanations. This study investigated how dynamical systems theory could be used to reveal linguistic patterns that are predictive of self-explanation quality. High school students (n = 232) generated self-explanations while they read a science text. Recurrence Plots were generated to show qualitative differences in students’ linguistic sequences that were later quantified by indices derived by Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). To predict self-explanation quality, RQA indices, along with summative measures (i.e., number of words, mean word length, and type-token ration) and general reading ability, served as predictors in a series of regression models. Regression analyses indicated that recurrence in students’ self-explanations significantly predicted human rated self-explanation quality, even after controlling for summative measures of self-explanations, individual differences, and the text that was read (R2 = 0.68). These results demonstrate the utility of RQA in exposing and quantifying temporal structure in student’s self-explanations. Further, they imply that dynamical systems methodology can be used to uncover important processes that occur during comprehension. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In recent years, the connection between Learning Design (LD) and Learning Analytics (LA) has been emphasized by many scholars as it could enhance our interpretation of LA findings and translate them to meaningful interventions. Together with numerous conceptual studies, a gradual accumulation of empirical evidence has indicated a strong connection between how instructors design for learning and student behaviour. Nonetheless, students’ timing of engagement and its relation to LD and academic performance have received limited attention. Therefore, this study investigates to what extent students’ timing of engagement aligned with instructor learning design, and how engagement varied across different levels of performance. The analysis was conducted over 28 weeks using trace data, on 387 students, and replicated over two semesters in 2015 and 2016. Our findings revealed a mismatch between how instructors designed for learning and how students studied in reality. In most weeks, students spent less time studying the assigned materials on the VLE compared to the number of hours recommended by instructors. The timing of engagement also varied, from in advance to catching up patterns. High-performing students spent more time studying in advance, while low-performing students spent a higher proportion of their time on catching-up activities. This study reinforced the importance of pedagogical context to transform analytics into actionable insights. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Reflective writing has been widely recognized as one of the most effective activities for fostering students’ reflective and critical thinking. The analysis of students’ reflective writings has been the focus of many research studies. However, to date this has been typically a very labor-intensive manual process involving content analysis of student writings. With recent advancements in the field of learning analytics, there have been several attempts to use text analytics to examine student reflective writings. This paper presents the results of a study examining the use of theoretically-sound linguistic indicators of different psychological processes for the development of an analytics system for assessment of reflective writing. More precisely, we developed a random-forest classification system using linguistic indicators provided by the LIWC and Coh-Metrix tools. We also examined what particular indicators are representative of the different types of student reflective writings. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

We provide descriptive properties of the network, demonstrating that the coenrollment networks evaluated follow power-law degree distributions similar to many other large-scale networks; that they reveal strong performance-based assortativity; and that network-based features can significantly improve GPA-based student performance predictors. We then implement a network-based, multi-view classification model to predict students’ final course grades. In particular, we adapt a structural modeling approach from [19, 34], whereby we model the university-wide undergraduate coenrollment network as an undirected graph. We compare the performance of our predictor to traditional methods used for grade prediction in undergraduate university courses, and demonstrate that a multi-view ensembling approach outperforms both prior “flat” and network-based models for grade prediction across several classification metrics. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of combining diverse approaches in models of student success, and demonstrate specific network-based modeling strategies which are likely to be most effective for grade prediction. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

This paper reports on the development of the MOOC Replication Framework (MORF), a framework that facilitates the replication of previously published findings across multiple data sets and the seamless integration of new findings as new research is conducted or new hypotheses are generated. In the proof of concept presented here, we use MORF to attempt to replicate 15 previously published findings across 29 iterations of 17 MOOCs. The findings indicate that 12 of the 15 findings replicated significantly across the data sets, and that two findings replicated significantly in the opposite direction. MORF enables larger-scale analysis of MOOC research questions than previously feasible, and enables researchers around the world to conduct analyses on huge multi-MOOC data sets without having to negotiate access to data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Students’ satisfaction from educational resources is a subjective perception of how well these resources meet students’ expectations for learning. Recommending educational resources to groups of students, targeting at optimizing all students’ satisfaction, is a complicated task due to the lack of joint group profiles. Instead of merging individual profiles or fusing individual recommendations, this paper follows a game-theoretic perspective for solving conflict of interest among students and recommending resources to groups in online collaborative learning contexts: the group members are the players, the resources comprise the set of possible actions, and maximizing each individual member’s satisfaction from the selected resources is a problem of finding the Nash Equilibrium. In case the Nash Equilibrium is Pareto efficient, none of the players can get more payoff (satisfaction) without decreasing the payoff of any other player, indicating an optimal benefit for the group as a whole. The comparative evaluation of the suggested approach to other state-of-the-art methods provided statistically significant results regarding the error in predicted group satisfaction from the recommendation and the goodness of the ranked list of recommendations. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

More specifically, our method generates a model for an individual student and performs minute-by-minute change detection based on click events during a classroom lecture. We collected clickstream data from four face-to-face lectures, and conducted experiments to demonstrate how the proposed method discovered change points and how such change points correlated with the students’ performances. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Video materials have become an integral part of university learning and teaching practice. While empirical research concerning the use of videos for educational purposes has increased, the literature lacks an overview of the specific effects of videos on diverse learning outcomes. To address such a gap, this paper presents preliminary results of a large-scale systematic review of peer-reviewed empirical studies published from 2007-2017. The study synthesizes the trends observed through the analysis of 178 papers selected from the screening of 2531 abstracts. The findings summarize the effects of manipulating video presentation, content and tasks on learning outcomes, such as recall, transfer, academic achievement, among others. The study points out the gap between large-scale analysis of fine-grained data on video interaction and experimental findings reliant on established psychological instruments. Narrowing this gap is suggested as the future direction for the research on video-based learning. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Higher education institutions in the United States and across the Western world face a critical problem of attrition of college students and this problem is particularly acute within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Students are especially vulnerable in the initial years of their academic programs; more than 60% of the dropouts occur in the first two years. Therefore, early identification of at-risk students is crucial for a focused intervention if institutions are to support students towards completion. In this paper we developed and evaluated a survival analysis framework for the early identification of students at the risk of dropping out. We compared the performance of survival analysis approaches to other machine learning approaches including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting. The proposed methods show good performance for early prediction of at-risk students and are also able to predict when a student will dropout with high accuracy. We performed a comparative analysis of nine different majors with varying levels of academic rigor, challenge and student body. This study enables advisors and university administrators to intervene in advance to improve student retention. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This paper aims to link student facing Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) to the corpus of research on Open Learner Models (OLMs), as both have similar goals. We conducted a systematic review of literature on OLMs and compared the results with a previously conducted review of LADs for learners in terms of (i) data use and modelling, (ii) key publication venues, (iii) authors and articles, (iv) key themes, and (v) system evaluation. We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60% are based on a single type of data; 33% use behavioral metrics; 39% support input from the user; 37% have complex models; and just 6% involve multiple applications. Key associated themes include intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and self-regulated learning. Notably, compared with LADs, OLM research is more likely to be interactive (81% of papers compared with 31% for LADs), report evaluations (76% versus 59%), use assessment data (100% versus 37%), provide a comparison standard for students (52% versus 38%), but less likely to use behavioral metrics, or resource use data (33% against 75% for LADs). In OLM work, there was a heightened focus on learner control and access to their own data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Accurately modeling individual students’ knowledge growth is important in many applications of learning analytics. A key step is to decompose the knowledge targeted in the instruction into detailed knowledge components (KCs). We search for an accurate KC model for basic equation solving skills, using data from an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), Lynnette. Key criteria are data fit and predictive accuracy based on a standard logistic model called the Additive Factors Model (AFM). We focus on three difficulty factors for equation solving: understanding of variables, the negative sign, and the complexity of the equation. Fine-grained KC models were found to have greater fit and predictive accuracy than an “ideal,” more abstract model, indicating that there is substantial under-generalization in students’ equation-solving skill related to all three difficulty factors. The work enhances scientific understanding of the challenges students face in learning equation solving. It illustrates how learning analytics could inform the improvement of technology-enhanced learning environments. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This study examined the relationship between discussion forum contributions and course assessment results in a statistics MOOC. An important feature of the study is that it distinguished between discussions that were related to the learning of course material (“content-related”) and those which were not (“non-content”). Another contribution is that the study evaluated the additional usefulness of social centrality measures in predicting course grade after the quantity of forum contributions has been accounted for. Results showed that, overall, 15% of course learners contributed to the forums and these learners had a significantly higher rate of successfully passing the course than non-contributors (64% vs 32% passing). Learners who made posts to both content-related and non-content threads had a higher passing rate than those who only contributed to one type or the other. Among learners who successfully passed the course, there were no differences in course grade when comparing discussion contributors and non-contributors overall; however those who contributed to content-related threads performed slightly better than those who did not (course grade of 87% vs 85%). A predictive model based on the number of posts made to content-related threads explained a small proportion of variance in course grades; addition of social centrality measures did not significantly improve the variance explained by the model. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The 2n LAK Failathon will build on the successful event in 2016 and extend the workshop beyond discussing individual experiences of failure to exploring how the field can improve, particularly regarding the creation and use of evidence. Failure in research is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile crises of confidence in the published research literature in medicine and psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings. These incentives prevent the field in general from learning from negative findings, and almost entirely preclude the publication of mistakes and errors. Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to learn from each other's failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants learn from each other's mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. This workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to learn from each other's failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The pathways and learning outcomes of university students are the culmination of numerous experiences inside and outside of the classroom, with faculty and with other students, in both formal and casual settings. These interactions are guided by the general education requirements of the university and by the learning goals of the student. The only official record and representation of each student's education is captured by their academic transcript: typically a list of courses described by name and number, grades recorded on an A-F scale and summarized by GPA, degrees awarded, and honors received. This limited approach reflects the technological affordances of a 20th century industrial age. In recent years, scholars have begun to imagine a transcript of the future, perhaps combining a richer record of the student experience along with a portfolio of authentic products of student work. In this paper, we concentrate on first, and develop analytic methods for improving measures of both classroom performance and intellectual breadth. In each case, this is done by placing elements of individual transcripts in context using information about their peers. We frame the study by addressing basic questions. Were the courses taken by the student difficult on average? Did the individual stand out from their peers? Were the courses representative of a broad intellectual experience, or did the student delve into detail in the chosen field of study? And with whom did they take courses? © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Among all of the learners in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) who intend to complete a course, the majority fail to do so. This intention-action gap is found in many domains of human experience, and research in similar goal pursuit domains suggests that plan-making is a cheap and effective nudge to encourage follow-through. In a natural field experiment in three HarvardX courses, some students received open-ended planning prompts at the beginning of a course. These prompts increased course completion by 29%, and payment for certificates by 40%. This effect was largest for students enrolled in traditional schools. Furthermore, the contents of students' plans could predict which students were least likely to succeed - in particular, students whose plans focused on specific times were unlikely to complete the course. Our results suggest that planning prompts can help learners adopted productive frames of mind at the outset of a learning goal that encourage and forecast student success. © 2017 ACM.},

Together with information gathered from a quantitative as well as a qualitative evaluation of the activity widget during the course, the findings of this current study show that there are indeed predictive relations between the widget indicators and the grades, especially those regarding responsiveness, and indicate that some of the observed differences in the last run could be attributed to the implemented activity widget. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The creation of Inclusive and Accessible Open Educational Resources (IA-OERs) is a challenge for teachers because they have to invest time and effort to create learning contents considering students' learning needs and preferences. An IA-OER is characterized by its alignment with the Universal Design Learning (UDL) principles, the quality on its contents and the web accessibility as a way to address the diversity of students. Creating an IA-OER with these characteristics is not a straightforward task, especially when teachers do not have enough information/feedback to make decisions on how to improve the learning contents. In this paper we introduce ATCE - an Analytics Tool to Trace the Creation and Evaluation of IA-OERs. This tool focuses in particular on the accessibility and quality of the IA-OERs. ATCE was developed as a module within the ATutor Learning Management System (LMS). An analytics dashboard with visualizations related to the teachers' competences in the creation and evaluation of IA-OERs was included as part of the tool. This paper also presents a use case of the visualizations obtained from the creation and evaluation of one IA-OER after using our analytics tool. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={It is difficult for a student to succeed in a course without access to course materials and assignments; and yet, some students delay up to a month in obtaining access to these essential materials. Students delay buying material required for their course due to multiple reasons. Out of a concern for students with limited financial resources, some publishers offer a period of free courtesy access. But this may lead to students having access later in the course but then having a lapsed period until they pay for the materials after the courtesy access period ends. Not having key course materials early on probably hurts learning, but how much? In this paper, we investigate the question, "Does lack of access to instructional material impact student performance in blended learning courses?" Specifically, we analyze students who purchased and obtained access to online content at different points in the course. We determine that both types of failure to obtain access to course materials (delaying in signing up for the product, or signing up for a free trial and letting the trial period lapse without purchasing the materials) are associated with substantially worse student outcomes. Students who purchased the product within the first few days of class had the best scores (median 77). Those who waited two weeks before accessing the product did the worst (median 56, effect size Cliff's Delta=0.311). We conclude with a discussion of possible interventions and actions that can be taken to ameliorate the situation. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In online social learning environments, tagging has demonstrated its potential to facilitate search, to improve recommendations and to foster reflection and learning. Studies have shown that shared understanding needs to be established in the group as a prerequisite for learning. We hypothesise that this can be fostered through tag recommendation strategies that contribute to semantic stabilization. In this study, we investigate the application of two tag recommenders that are inspired by models of human memory: (i) the base-level learning equation BLL and (ii) Minerva. BLL models the frequency and recency of tag use while Minerva is based on frequency of tag use and semantic context. We test the impact of both tag recommenders on semantic stabilization in an online study with 56 students completing a group-based inquiry learning project in school. We find that displaying tags from other group members contributes significantly to semantic stabilization in the group, as compared to a strategy where tags from the students' individual vocabularies are used. Testing for the accuracy of the different recommenders revealed that algorithms using frequency counts such as BLL performed better when individual tags were recommended. When group tags were recommended, the Minerva algorithm performed better. We conclude that tag recommenders, exposing learners to each other's tag choices by simulating search processes on learners' semantic memory structures, show potential to support semantic stabilization and thus, inquiry-based learning in groups. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In online learning environments, learners are often required to be more autonomous in their approach to learning. In scaled online learning environments, like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), there are differences in the ability of learners to access teachers and peers to get help with their study than in more traditional educational environments. This exploratory study examines the help-seeking behaviour of learners across several MOOCs with different audiences and designs. Learning analytics techniques (e.g., dimension reduction with t-sne and clustering with affinity propagation) were applied to identify clusters and determine profiles of learners on the basis of their help-seeking behaviours. Five helpseeking learner profiles were identified which provide an insight into how learners' help-seeking behaviour relates to performance. The development of a more in-depth understanding of how learners seek help in large online learning environments is important to inform the way support for learners can be incorporated into the design and facilitation of online courses delivered at scale. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success. In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning. The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them. In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty. © 2017 ACM.},

Content-related, non-content, and unpartitioned interaction networks were constructed based on five different tie definitions: Direct Reply, Star, Direct Reply+Star, Limited Copresence, and Total Copresence. Results showed content-related and non-content networks to have distinct characteristics at the network, community, and individual node levels, validating the usefulness of the content/non-content distinction as an analytic tool. Network properties were less sensitive to differences in tie definition with the exception of Total Copresence, which showed distinct characteristics presenting dangers for general use, but usefulness for detecting inflated social status due to "superthread" initiation.

abstract={Many universities choose the C programming language (C) as the first one they teach their students, early on in their program. However, students often consider programming courses difficult, and these courses often have among the highest dropout rates of computer science courses offered. It is therefore critical to provide more effective instruction to help students understand the syntax of C and prevent them losing interest in programming. In addition, homework and paper-based exams are still the main assessment methods in the majority of classrooms. It is difficult for teachers to grasp students' learning situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. To facilitate teaching and learning of C, in this article we propose a system-LAPLE (Learning Analytics in Programming Language Education)-that provides a learning dashboard to capture the behavior of students in the classroom and identify the different difficulties faced by different students looking at different knowledge. With LAPLE, teachers may better grasp students' learning situation in real time and better improve educational materials using analysis results. For their part, novice undergraduate programmers may use LAPLE to locate syntax errors in C and get recommendations from educational materials on how to fix them. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In this study, we investigated the degree to which the cognitive processes in which students engage during reading comprehension could be examined through dynamical analyses of their natural language responses to texts. High school students (n = 142) generated typed self-explanations while reading a science text. They then completed a comprehension test that measured their comprehension at both surface and deep levels. The recurrent patterns of the words in students' self-explanations were first visualized in recurrence plots. These visualizations allowed us to qualitatively analyze the different self-explanation processes of skilled and less skilled readers. These recurrence plots then allowed us to calculate recurrence indices, which represented the properties of these temporal word patterns. Results of correlation and regression analyses revealed that these recurrence indices were significantly related to the students' comprehension scores at both surface- and deep levels. Additionally, when combined with summative metrics of word use, these indices were able to account for 32% of the variance in students' overall text comprehension scores. Overall, our results suggest that recurrence quantification analysis can be utilized to guide both qualitative and quantitative assessments of students' comprehension. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={K-12 classrooms use block-based programming environments (BBPEs) for teaching computer science and computational thinking (CT). To support assessment of student learning in BBPEs, we propose a learning analytics framework that combines hypothesis- and data-driven approaches to discern students' programming strategies from BBPE log data. We use a principled approach to design assessment tasks to elicit evidence of specific CT skills. Piloting these tasks in high school classrooms enabled us to analyze student programs and video recordings of students as they built their programs. We discuss a priori patterns derived from this analysis to support data-driven analysis of log data in order to better assess understanding and use of CT in BBPEs. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Policy for learning analytics joins a stream of initiatives aimed at understanding the expanding world of information collection, storage, processing and dissemination that is being driven by computing technologies. This paper offers a information policy perspective on learning analytics, joining work by others on ethics and privacy in the management of learning analytics data [8], but extending to consider how issues play out across the information lifecycle and in the formation of policy. Drawing on principles from information policy both informs learning analytics and brings learning analytics into the information policy domain. The resulting combination can help inform policy development for educational institutions as they implement and manage learning analytics policy and practices. The paper begins with a brief summary of the information policy perspective, then addresses learning analytics with attention to various categories of consideration for policy development. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Social comparison theory asserts that we establish our social and personal worth by comparing ourselves to others. In in-person learning environments, social comparison offers students critical feedback on how to behave and be successful. By contrast, online learning environments afford fewer social cues to facilitate social comparison. Can increased availability of such cues promote effective self-regulatory behavior and achievement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)? We developed a personalized feedback system that facilitates social comparison with previously successful learners based on an interactive visualization of multiple behavioral indicators. Across four randomized controlled trials in MOOCs (overall N = 33, 726), we find: (1) the availability of social comparison cues significantly increases completion rates, (2) this type of feedback benefits highly educated learners, and (3) learners' cultural context plays a significant role in their course engagement and achievement. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Where is the evidence for learning analytics? In particular, where is the evidence that it improves learning in practice? Can we rely on it? Currently, there are vigorous debates about the quality of research evidence in medicine and psychology, with particular issues around statistical good practice, the 'file drawer effect', and ways in which incentives for stakeholders in the research process reward the quantity of research produced rather than the quality. In this paper, we present the Learning Analytics Community Exchange (LACE) project's Evidence Hub, an effort to relate research evidence in learning analytics to four propositions about learning analytics: whether they support learning, support teaching, are deployed widely, and are used ethically. Surprisingly little evidence in this strong, specific sense was found, and very little was negative (7%, N=123), suggesting that learning analytics is not immune from the pressures in other areas. We explore the evidence in one particular area in detail (whether learning analytics improve teaching and learners support in the university sector), and set out some of the weaknesses of the evidence available. We conclude that there is considerable scope for improving the evidence base for learning analytics, and set out some suggestions of ways for various stakeholders to achieve this. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In this integrated study of dynamics in MOOCs discussion forums, we analyze the interplay of temporal patterns, discussion content, and the social structure emerging from the communication using mixed methods. A special focus is on the yet under-explored aspect of time dynamics and influence of the course structure on forum participation. Our analyses show dependencies between the course structure (video opening time and assignment deadlines) and the overall forum activity whereas such a clear link could only be partially observed considering the discussion content. For analyzing the social dimension we apply role modeling techniques from social network analysis. While the types of user roles based on connection patterns are relatively stable over time, the high fluctuation of active contributors lead to frequent changes from active to passive roles during the course. However, while most users do not create many social connections they can play an important role in the content dimension triggering discussions on the course subject. Finally, we show that forum activity level can be predicted one week in advance based on the course structure, forum activity history and attributes of the communication network which enables identification of periods when increased tutor supports in the forum is necessary. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are commonly designed to enhance student learning. However, they are not typically designed to meet the needs of teachers who use them in their classrooms. ITSs generate a wealth of analytics about student learning and behavior, opening a rich design space for real-time teacher support tools such as dashboards. Whereas real-time dashboards for teachers have become popular with many learning technologies, we are not aware of projects that have designed dashboards for ITSs based on a broad investigation of teachers' needs. We conducted design interviews with ten middle school math teachers to explore their needs for on-the-spot support during blended class sessions, as a first step in a user-centered design process of a real-time dashboard. Based on multi-methods analyses of this interview data, we identify several opportunities for ITSs to better support teachers' needs, noting that the analytics commonly generated by existing teacher support tools do not strongly align with the analytics teachers expect to be most useful. We highlight key tensions and tradeoffs in the design of such realtime supports for teachers, as revealed by "Speed Dating" possible futures with teachers. This paper has implications for our ongoing co-design of a real-time dashboard for ITSs, as well as broader implications for the design of ITSs that can effectively collaborate with teachers in classroom settings. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={An ongoing study is being run to ensure that the McGraw-Hill Education LearnSmart platform teaches students as efficiently as possible. The first step in doing so is to identify what Knowledge Components (KCs) exist in the content; while the content is tagged by experts, these tags need to be re-calibrated periodically. LearnSmart courses are organized into chapters corresponding to those found in a textbook; each chapter can have anywhere from about a hundred to a few thousand questions. The KC extraction algorithms proposed by Barnes [1] and Desmarais et al [3] are applied on a chapter-by-chapter basis. To assess the ability of each mined q matrix to describe the observed learning, the PFA model of Pavlik et al [4] is fitted to it and a cross-validated AUC is calculated. The models are assessed based on whether PFA's predictions of student correctness are accurate. Early results show that both algorithms do a reasonable job of describing student progress, but q matrices with very different numbers of KCs fit observed data similarly well. Consequently, further consideration is required before automated extraction is practical in this context. © 2017 ACM.},

This paper used a person-centered approach to explore students' (N = 65) facial behavior, emotions, learner traits and learning. An automatic facial expression recognition system was used to detect both middle school and university students' real-time facial movements while they learned scientific tasks in a 3D narrative video game. The results indicated a strong statistical relationship between three specific facial movements (i.e., outer brow raising, lip tightening and lip pressing), student self-regulatory learning strategy and learning performance. Outer brow raising (AU2) had strong predictive power when a student is confronted with obstacles and does not know how to proceed. Both lip tightening and pressing (AU23 and AU24) were predictive when a student engaged in a task that requires a deep level of incoming information processing and short memory activation. The findings also suggested a correlational relationship between student self-regulatory learning strategy use and neutral state. It is hoped that this study will provide empirical evidence for helping us develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between facial behavior and complex learning especially in educational games. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Learning analytics open up a complex landscape of privacy and policy issues, which, in turn, influence how learning analytics systems and practices are designed. Research and development is governed by regulations for data storage and management, and by research ethics. Consequently, when moving solutions out the research labs implementers meet constraints defined in national laws and justified in privacy frameworks. This paper explores how the OECD, APEC and EU privacy frameworks seek to regulate data privacy, with significant implications for the discourse of learning, and ultimately, an impact on the design of tools, architectures and practices that now are on the drawing board. A detailed list of requirements for learning analytics systems is developed, based on the new legal requirements defined in the European General Data Protection Regulation, which from 2018 will be enforced as European law. The paper also gives an initial account of how the privacy discourse in Europe, Japan, South-Korea and China is developing and reflects upon the possible impact of the different privacy frameworks on the design of LA privacy solutions in these countries. This research contributes to knowledge of how concerns about privacy and data protection related to educational data can drive a discourse on new approaches to privacy engineering based on the principles of Privacy by Design. For the LAK community, this study represents the first attempt to conceptualise the issues of privacy and learning analytics in a cross-cultural context. The paper concludes with a plan to follow up this research on privacy policies and learning analytics systems development with a new international study. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={This work provides an overview of an education and technology monitoring system developed at Plan Ceibal, a nationwide initiative created to enable technology enhanced learning in Uruguay. Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={As is the case for many undergraduate STEM degree programs, computing degree programs are plagued by high attrition rates. This is especially true in early computing courses, in which failure and drop-out rates in the 35 to 50 percent range are common. By collecting learning process data as students engage in computer programming assignments, computing educators can place themselves in a position not only to better understand students' struggles, but also to better tailor instructional interventions to students' needs. We have developed OSBLE+, a learning management and analytics environment that interfaces with a computer programming environment to support the automatic collection of learners' programming process and social data as they work on programming assignments, while also providing an interactive environment for the analysis and visualization of those data. In ongoing work, we are using OSBLE+ to explore two possibilities: (a) leveraging learning and social data to strategically deliver automated learning interventions, and (b) presenting learners with visual representations of their learning data in order to prompt them to reflect on and discuss their learning processes. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Learning analytics research has often been touted as a means to address concerns regarding student retention outcomes. However, few research studies to date, have examined the impact of the implemented intervention strategies designed to address such retention challenges. Moreover, the methodological rigor of some of the existing studies has been challenged. This study evaluates the impact of a pilot retention program. The study contrasts the findings obtained by the use of different methods for analysis of the effect of the intervention. The pilot study was undertaken between 2012 and 2014 resulting in a combined enrolment of 11,160 students. A model to predict attrition was developed, drawing on data from student information system, learning management system interactions, and assessment. The predictive model identified some 1868 students as academically at-risk. Early interventions were implemented involving learning and remediation support. Common statistical methods demonstrated a positive association between the intervention and student retention. However, the effect size was low. The use of more advanced statistical methods, specifically mixed-effect methods explained higher variability in the data (over 99%), yet found the intervention had no effect on the retention outcomes. The study demonstrates that more data about individual differences is required to not only explain retention but to also develop more effective intervention approaches. © 2017 ACM.},

Existing techniques are mostly based on students' performance and on timing features. However, research in education, psychology and educational data mining has demonstrated that students' choices and strategies substantially influence learning. In this paper, we investigate the impact of students' exploration strategies on learning and propose the use of a probabilistic model jointly representing student knowledge and strategies. Our analyses are based on data collected from an interactive computer-based game. Our results show that exploration strategies are a significant predictor of the learning outcome. Furthermore, the joint models of performance and knowledge significantly improve the prediction accuracy within the game as well as on external post-test data, indicating that this combined representation provides a better proxy for learning. © 2017 ACM.},

A discussion forum consisting of 281 posts on an online collaborative learning environment was investigated. A text-mining tool was used to discover keywords from the discourse, and through social network analysis based on these keywords, a significant presence of relevant and promising ideas within discourse was revealed. However, uncovering the key ideas alone is insufficient to clearly explain students' level of understanding regarding the discussed topics. A more thorough analysis was thus performed by using temporal analytics with step-wise discourse analysis to trace the ideas and determine their impact on communal discourse. The results indicated that most ideas within the discourse could be traced to the origin of a set of improvable ideas, which impacted and also increased the community's level of interest in sharing and discussing ideas through discourse. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Learning Pulse explores whether using a machine learning approach on multimodal data such as heart rate, step count, weather condition and learning activity can be used to predict learning performance in self-regulated learning settings. An experiment was carried out lasting eight weeks involving PhD students as participants, each of them wearing a Fitbit HR wristband and having their application on their computer recorded during their learning and working activities throughout the day. A software infrastructure for collecting multimodal learning experiences was implemented. As part of this infrastructure a Data Processing Application was developed to pre-process, analyse and generate predictions to provide feedback to the users about their learning performance. Data from different sources were stored using the xAPI standard into a cloud-based Learning Record Store. The participants of the experiment were asked to rate their learning experience through an Activity Rating Tool indicating their perceived level of productivity, stress, challenge and abilities. These self-reported performance indicators were used as markers to train a Linear Mixed Effect Model to generate learner-specific predictions of the learning performance. We discuss the advantages and the limitations of the used approach, highlighting further development points. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Emotions play a critical role during learning and problem solving with advanced learning technologies (ALTs). Despite their importance, relatively few attempts have been made to understand learners' emotional monitoring and regulation by using data visualizations of their own (and others') cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) self-regulated learning (SRL) processes to potentially foster their emotion regulation (ER). We present a theoretically based and empirically driven conceptual framework that addresses ER by proposing the use of visualizations of one's own and others' CAMM SRL multichannel data to facilitate learners' monitoring and regulation of emotions during learning with ALTs. We use an example with eye-tracking data to illustrate the mapping between theoretical assumptions, ER strategies, and the types of data visualizations that can enhance learners' ER, including key processes such as emotion flexibility, emotion adaptivity, and emotion efficacy. We conclude with future directions leading to a systematic interdisciplinary research agenda that addresses outstanding ER-related issues by integrating models, theories, methods, and analytical techniques for the cognitive, learning, and affective sciences; human-computer interaction (HCI); data visualization; big data; data mining; and SRL. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Crowdsourcing has become an increasingly popular means to acquire human input on demand. Microtask crowdsourcing marketplaces facilitate the access to millions of people (called workers) who are willing to participate in tasks in return for monetary rewards or other forms of compensation. This paradigm presents a unique learning context where workers have to learn to complete tasks on-the-fly by applying their learning immediately through the course of tasks. However, most workers typically dropout early in large batches of tasks, depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn on-the-fly through the course of batch completion. By doing so workers squander a potential chance at improving their performance and completing tasks effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel method to engage and retain workers, to improve their learning in crowdsourced information finding tasks by using achievement priming. Through rigorous experimental findings, we show that it is possible to retain workers in long batches of tasks by triggering their inherent motivation to achieve and excel. As a consequence of increased worker retention, we find that workers learn to perform more effectively, depicting relatively more stable accuracy and lower task completion times in comparison to workers who drop out early. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Science epistemology, or beliefs about what it means to do science and how science knowledge is generated, is an integral part of authentic science inquiry. Although the development of a sophisticated science epistemology is critical for attaining science literacy, epistemology remains an elusive construct to precisely and quantitatively evaluate. Previous work has suggested that analysis of student practices in science inquiry, such as their use of language, may be reflective of their underlying epistemologies. Here we describe the usage of a learning analytics tool, TAALES, and keyness analysis to analyze the concluding statements made by students at the end of a computer-based authentic science inquiry experience. Preliminary results indicate that linguistic analysis reveals differences in domain-general lexical sophistication and in domain-specific verb usage that are consistent with the expertise level of the participant. For example, experts tend to use more hedging language such as "may" and "support" during conclusions whereas novices use stronger language such as "cause." Using these differences, a simple, rulebased prediction algorithm with LOOCV achieved prediction accuracies of greater than 80%. These data underscore the potential for the use of learning analytics in simulated authentic inquiry to provide a novel and valuable method of assessing inquiry practices and related epistemologies. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The scholarly investigation of discourse in teaching and learning is multi-disciplinary, theoretically rich, and highly technical. Researchers with backgrounds in education, cognitive psychology, computer science, and the social sciences apply a diverse set of techniques to understand how student discussions affect learning. Aided by big data coming from learning content management and massive open online course systems, these researchers have an unparalleled opportunity for insight into the teaching and learning process. In this paper we summarize some of the challenges and opportunities arising out of three workshops on Educational Discourse. These workshops convened both expert and emerging scholars to discuss the (i) ethical, (ii) technical, and (iii) infrastructure barriers to building a research community focused on computer-mediated educational discourse. Of particular note is that while computational infrastructure exists for storing and manipulating educational discourse, there is a need for a sociotechnical infrastructure upon which community members can come together to engage in joint work. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Grouping students with similar past achievement together (tracking) might affect their reading achievement. Multilevel analyses of 208,057 fourth grade students in 40 countries showed that clustering students in schools by past achievement was linked to higher reading achievement, consistent with the benefits of customized, targeted instruction. Meanwhile, students had higher reading achievement with greater differences (variances) among classmates' past achievement, reading attitudes, or family SES; these results are consistent with the view that greater student differences yield more help opportunities (higher achievers help lower achievers, so that both learn), and foster learning from their different resources, attitudes and behaviors. Also, a student had higher reading achievement when classmates had more resources (SES, home educational resources, reading attitude, past achievement), suggesting that classmates shared their resources and helped one another. Modeling of non-linear relations and achievement subsamples of students supported the above interpretations. Principals can use these results and a simpler version of this methodology to re-allocate students and resources into different course sections at little cost to improve students' reading achievement. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Learners' emotional state has proven to be a key factor for successful learning. Visualizing learners' emotions during synchronous on-line learning activities can help tutors in creating and maintaining socio-affective relationships with their learners. However, few dashboards offer emotional information on the learning activity. The current study focuses on synchronous interactions via a videoconferencing tool dedicated to foreign language training. We collected data on learners' emotions in real conditions during ten sessions (five sessions for two learners). We propose to adopt and combine different models of emotions (discrete and dimensional) and to use heterogeneous APIs for measuring learners' emotions from different data sources (audio, video, self-reporting and interaction traces). Based on a thorough data analysis, we propose an approach to combine different cues to infer information on learners' emotional states. We finally present the EMODA dashboard, an affective multimodal and contextual visual analytics dashboard, which allows the tutor to monitor learners' emotions and better understand their evolution during the synchronous learning activity. © 2017 ACM.},

We use records from the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and analyse the activity of previous students. We assume that the activity of past students represents patterns, which can be used as a basis for recommendations to current students. The measures we define are Relevance, for description of a supposed VLE activity derived from previous students of the course, and Effort, that represents the actual effort of individual current students. Based on these measures, we propose a composite measure, which we call Importance. We use data from the previous course presentations to evaluate of the consistency of students' behaviour. We use correlation of the defined measures Relevance and Average Effort to evaluate the behaviour of two different student cohorts and the Root Mean Square Error to measure the deviation of Average Effort and individual student Effort. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Student knowledge modeling is an important part of modern personalized learning systems, but typically relies upon valid models of the structure of the content and skill in a domain. These models are often developed through expert tagging of skills to items. However, content creators in crowdsourced personalized learning systems often lack the time (and sometimes the domain knowledge) to tag skills themselves. Fully automated approaches that rely on the covariance of correctness on items can lead to effective skill-item mappings, but the resultant mappings are often difficult to interpret. In this paper we propose an alternate approach to automatically labeling skills in a crowdsourced personalized learning system using correlated topic modeling, a natural language processing approach, to analyze the linguistic content of mathematics problems. We find a range of potentially meaningful and useful topics within the context of the ASSISTments system for mathematics problem-solving. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={This workshop aims to promote strategic planning for learning analytics in higher education through developing institutional policies. While adoption of learning analytics is predominantly seen in small-scale and bottom-up patterns, it is believed that a systemic implementation can bring the widest impact to the education system and lasting benefits to learners. However, the success of it highly depends on the adopted strategy that meets the needs of various stakeholders and systematically pushes the institution towards achieving its targets. It is imperative to develop a learning analytics policy that ensures a practice that is valid, effective and ethical. The workshop involves two components. The first component includes a set of presentations about the state of learning analytics in higher education, drawing on results from an Australian and a European project examining institutional learning analytics policy and adoption processes. The second component is an interactive session where participants are encouraged to share their motivations for adopting learning analytics and the diversity of challenges they perceive impede analytics adoption in their institution. Using the RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach (ROMA), participants will create a draft policy that articulates how the various challenges can be addressed. This workshop aims to further develop our understanding of how learning analytics operates in an organizational system and promote a cultural change in how such analytics are adopted in higher education. © 2017 ACM.},

This paper (1) discusses the extant literature on sequential and process analyses of writing; and, based on this and our own first-hand experience on sequential analysis, (2) proposes a number of approaches to both pre-process and analyse sequences in whole-texts. We illustrate how the approaches could be applied to examples drawn from our own datasets of 'rhetorical moves' in written texts, and the potential each approach holds for providing insight into that data. Work is in progress to apply this model to provide empirical insights. Although, similar sequence or process mining techniques have not yet been applied to student writing, techniques applied to event data could readily be operationalised to undercover patterns in texts. © 2017 ACM.},

It has implications for both efforts to automate personalized instruction and to probabilistically model educational context. By modelling students as Bayesian learners, individuals who weigh their prior belief against current circumstantial data to reach conclusions, it becomes possible to both generate estimates of performance and the impact of the educational environment in probabilistic terms. This framework is tested through a Bayesian algorithm that can be used to characterize student prior knowledge in course material and predict student performance. This is demonstrated using both simulated data. The algorithm generates estimates that behave qualitatively as expected on simulated data and predict student performance substantially better than chance. A discussion of the results and the conceptual benefits of the framework follow. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={A number of studies have demonstrated links between linguistic knowledge and performance in math. Studies examining these links in first language speakers of English have traditionally relied on correlational analyses between linguistic knowledge tests and standardized math tests. For second language (L2) speakers, the majority of studies have compared math performance between proficient and non-proficient speakers of English. In this study, we take a novel approach and examine the linguistic features of student language while they are engaged in collaborative problem solving within an on-line math tutoring system. We transcribe the students' speech and use natural language processing tools to extract linguistic information related to text cohesion, lexical sophistication, and sentiment. Our criterion variables are individuals' pretest and posttest math performance scores. In addition to examining relations between linguistic features of student language production and math scores, we also control for a number of non-linguistic factors including gender, age, grade, school, and content focus (procedural versus conceptual). Linear mixed effect modeling indicates that non-linguistic factors are not predictive of math scores. However, linguistic features related to cohesion affect and lexical proficiency explained approximately 30% of the variance (R2 =.303) in the math scores. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Modeling has a strong focus in current science learning frameworks as a critical skill for students to learn. However, understanding students' scientific models and their modeling practices at scale is a difficult task that has not been taken up by the research literature. The complex variables involved in classroom learning, such as teacher differences, increase the difficulty of understanding this problem. This work begins with an exploration of the methods used to explore students' scientific modeling in the learning sciences space and the frameworks developed to characterize student modeling practices. Learning analytics can be used to leverage these frameworks of scientific modeling practices to explore questions around students' scientific models and their modeling practices. These analyses are focused around the use of EcoSurvey, a collaborative, digital tool used in high-school biology classrooms to model the local ecosystem. This tool was deployed in ten biology classrooms and used with varying degrees of success. There are significant teacher-level differences found in the activity sequences of students using the EcoSurvey tool. The theoretical metrics around scientific modeling practices and automatically extracted feature sequences were also used in a classification task to automatically determine a particular student's teacher. These results underline the power of learning analytics methods to give insight into how modeling practices are realized in the classroom. This work also informs changes to modeling tools, associated curricula, and supporting professional development around scientific modeling. © 2017 ACM.},

VASCORLL is a system for visualizing and analyzing the learning logs collected by the seamless learning system, which supports language learning in the real-world. As far, several studies have been made in the seamless learning environments in order to bridge formal learning over informal learning. However, their focus was the implementation of the seamless learning environment in education. This study focuses on visualizing and analyzing learning logs collected in the seamless learning environment. This paper describes how our analytics could contribute to bridging the gap between formal and informal learning. An experiment was conducted to evaluate 1) whether our developed VASCORLL is effective in connecting the words learned in formal learning to the ones learned in informal learning, 2) which social network algorithm is effective to enhance learning in the seamless learning environment. Twenty international students participated in the evaluation experiment, and they were able to increase their learning opportunities by using VASCORLL. In addition, it was found that the betweenness centrality is useful in finding central words bridging formal and informal learning. © 2017 ACM.},

These keywords have been derived from eight datasets, which contain several thousand instances using the log-likelihood method. Both performance measures, the accuracy and the Cohen's ?, for these keywords were estimated with ten-fold cross validation. The results reached an accuracy of 0.78 on average for all eight categories and a fair to good interrater reliability for most categories even though it did not make use of any sophisticated rule-based mechanisms or machine learning approaches.

abstract={Healthcare simulations are hands-on learning experiences aimed at allowing students to practice essential skills that they may need when working with real patients in clinical workplaces. Some clinical classrooms are equipped with patient manikins that can respond to actions or that can be programmed to deteriorate over time. Students can perform assessments and interventions, and enhance their critical thinking and communication skills. There is an opportunity to exploit the students' digital traces that these manikins can pervasively capture to make key aspects of the learning process visible. The setting can be augmented with sensors to capture traces of group interaction. These multimodal data can be used to generate visualisations or feedback for students or teachers. This paper reports on an authentic classroom study using analytics to integrate multimodal data of students' interactions with the manikins and their peers in simulation scenarios. We report on the challenges encountered in deploying such analytics 'in the wild', using an analysis framework that considers the social, epistemic and physical dimensions of collocated group activity. © 2017 ACM.},

If a student is matched with a problematic group of peers, then there will be no valid measurement of the CPS skills. In the human-agent settings, CPS skills are measured by pairing each individual student with a computer agent or agents that can be programmed to act as team members with varying characteristics relevant to different CPS skills and contexts. This paper describes current research on measuring CPS skills through human-agent interactions in a prototype of a collaborative educational game. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The ability to pay attention and self-regulate is a fundamental skill required of learners of all ages. Learning analytics researchers have to date relied on data generated by a computing system (such as a learning management system, click stream or log data) to examine learners' self-regulatory abilities. The development of wearable computing through fitness trackers, watches, heart rate monitors, and clinical grade devices such as Empatica's E4 wristband now provides researchers with access to biometric data as students interact with learning content or software systems. This level of data collection promises to provide valuable insight into cognitive and affective experiences of individuals, especially when combined with traditional learning analytics data sources. Our study details the use of wearable technologies to assess the relationship between heart rate variability and the self-regulatory abilities of an individual. This is relevant for the field of learning analytics as methods become more complex and the assessment of learner performance becomes more nuanced and attentive to the affective factors that contribute to learner success. © 2017 ACM.},

Learning analytics has the power to provide just-in-time support, especially when predictive analytics is married with the way teachers have designed their course, or so-called a learning design. This study investigates how learning designs are configured over time and their impact on student activities by analyzing longitudinal data of 38 modules with a total of 43,099 registered students over 30 weeks at the Open University UK, using social network analysis and panel data analysis. Our analysis unpacked dynamic configurations of learning designs between modules over time, which allows teachers to reflect on their practice in order to anticipate problems and make informed interventions. Furthermore, by controlling for the heterogeneity between modules, our results indicated that learning designs were able to explain up to 60% of the variability in student online activities, which reinforced the importance of pedagogical context in learning analytics. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In 2011, the phenomenon of MOOCs had swept the world of education and put online education in the focus of the public discourse around the world. Although researchers were excited with the vast amounts of MOOC data being collected, the benefits of this data did not stand to the expectations due to several challenges. The analyses of MOOC data are very time-consuming and labor-intensive, and require and require a highly advanced set of technical skills, often not available to the education researchers. Because of this MOOC data analyses are rarely done before the courses end, limiting the potential of data to impact the student learning outcomes and experience. In this paper we introduce MOOCito (MOOC intervention tool), a user-friendly software platform for the analysis of MOOC data, that focuses on conducting data-informed instructional interventions and course experimentations. We cover important design principles behind MOOCito and provide an overview of the trends in MOOC research leading to its development. Although a work-inprogress, in this paper, we outline the prototype of MOOCito and the results of a user evaluation study that focused on system's perceived usability and ease-of-use. The results of the study are discussed, as well as their practical implications. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Educational practitioners and policy makers require evidence supporting claims about educational efficacy. Evidence is often found using causal relationships between education inputs and student learning outcomes. Causal inference covers a wide range of topics in education research, including efficacy studies to prove if a new policy, software, curriculum or intervention is effective in improving student learning outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard method to demonstrate causality. However, these studies are expensive, timely and costly, as well as not being ethical to conduct in many educational contexts. Causality can also be deducted purely from observational data. In this tutorial, we will review methodologies for estimating the causal effects of education inputs on student learning outcomes using observational data. This is an inherently complex task due to many hidden variables and their interrelationships in educational research. In this tutorial, we discuss causal inference in the context of educational research with big data. This is the first tutorial of its kind at Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK) that provides a hands-on experience with Python and Apache Spark as a practical tool for educational researchers to conduct causal inference. As a prerequisite, attendees are required to have familiarity with Python. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to show how multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) can help understand how elementary students explore the concept of feedback loops while controlling an embodied simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem using hand movements as an interface with the computer simulation. We represent student motion patterns from fine-grained logs of hands and gaze data, and then map these observed motion patterns against levels of student performance to make inferences about how embodiment plays a role in the learning process. Results show five distinct motion sequences in students' embodied interactions, and these motion patterns are statistically associated with initial and post-tutorial levels of students' understanding of feedback loops. Analysis of student gaze also shows distinctive patterns as to how low- and high-performing students attended to information presented in the simulation. Using MMLA, we show how students' explanations of feedback loops look differently according to cluster membership, which provides evidence that embodiment interacts with conceptual understanding. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={For students, in particular freshmen, the degree pathway from semester to semester is not that transparent, although students have a reasonable idea what courses are expected to be taken each semester. An often-pondered question by students is: "what can I expect in the next semester?" More precisely, given the commitment and engagement I presented in this particular course and the respective performance I achieved, can I expect a similar outcome in the next semester in the particular course I selected? Are the demands and expectations in this course much higher so that I need to adjust my commitment and engagement and overall workload if I expect a similar outcome? Is it better to drop a course to manage expectations rather than to (predictably) fail, and perhaps have to leave the degree altogether? Degree and course advisors and student support units find it challenging to provide evidence based advise to students. This paper presents research into educational process mining and student data analytics in a whole university scale approach with the aim of providing insight into the degree pathway questions raised above. The beta-version of our course level degree pathway tool has been used to shed light for university staff and students alike into our university's 1,300 degrees and associated 6 million course enrolments over the past 20 years. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Classroom experiments that evaluate the effectiveness of educational technologies do not typically examine the effects of classroom contextual variables (e.g., out-of-software help-giving and external distractions). Yet these variables may influence students' instructional outcomes. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial Classroom Log Explorer (SPACLE): a prototype tool that facilitates the rapid discovery of relationships between withinsoftware and out-of-software events. Unlike previous tools for retrospective analysis, SPACLE replays moment-by-moment analytics about student and teacher behaviors in their original spatial context. We present a data analysis workflow using SPACLE and demonstrate how this workflow can support causal discovery. We share the results of our initial replay analyses using SPACLE, which highlight the importance of considering spatial factors in the classroom when analyzing ITS log data. We also present the results of an investigation into the effects of studentteacher interactions on student learning in K-12 blended classrooms, using our workflow, which combines replay analysis with SPACLE and causal modeling. Our findings suggest that students' awareness of being monitored by their teachers may promote learning, and that "gaming the system" behaviors may extend outside of educational software use. © 2017 ACM.},

Founded by a partnership between the Open University in the UK, the BBC, The British Library and (originally) 12 universities in the UK, FutureLearn has two distinctive features relevant to the way their data is displayed and analyzed:1) it was designed with a specific educational philosophy in mind which focuses on the social dimension of learning and 2) every learning activity provide opportunities for formal discussion and commenting. This workshop provides an opportunity to invite contributions and connect individual and groups to share their research activities on an international stage. As the first of its kind, this workshop will bring in a number of scholars and practitioners, as well as data scientists and analyst involved in the reporting, researching and developments emerging from the data offered by the platform. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The effect of choice on student achievement and engagement has been an extensively researched area of learning analytics. Current research findings suggest a positive relationship between choice and varied outcome measures, but little has been reported to indicate whether these findings hold in the context of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). In this paper, we report the results of a randomized controlled experiment in which we investigate the effect of student choice on assignment completion and future achievement in an ITS. The experimental design uses three conditions to observe the effect of choice. In the first condition, students are able to choose the order in which to complete assignments, while in the second condition, students are prescribed an intuitive order in which to complete assignments. Those in the third condition were prescribed a counter-intuitive order in which to complete assignments. Results indicate that allowing students to choose the order in which to work on assignments leads to higher completion rates and better achievement at posttest. A post-hoc analysis also revealed that even considering students with similar completion rates, those given choice had higher posttest scores than those observed in any other condition. These results seem to support the many theories of the positive effect of choice on student achievement. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={People in general and students in particular have a tendency to misinterpret their own abilities. Some tend to underestimate their skills, while others tend to overestimate them. This paper investigates the degree to which metacognition is asymmetric in real-world learning and examines the change of a students' confidence over the course of a semester and its impact on the students' academic performance. Our findings, conducted using 129,644 students learning in eight courses within the LearnSmart platform, indicate that poor or unrealistic metacognition is asymmetric. These students are biased in one direction: they are more likely to be overconfident than underconfident. Additionally, while the examination of the temporal aspects of confidence reveals no significant change throughout the semester, changes are more apparent in the first and the last few weeks of the course. More specifically, there is a sharp increase in underconfidence and a simultaneous decrease in realistic evaluation toward the end of the semester. Finally, both overconfidence and underconfidence seem to be correlated with students' overall course performance. An increase in overconfidence is related to higher overall performance, while an increase in underconfidence is associated with lower overall performance. © 2017 ACM.},

The results show that more considerations need to be given to establishing communication channels among stakeholders and adopting pedagogy-based approaches to learning analytics. It also reveals the shortage of guidance for developing data literacy among end-users and evaluating the progress and impact of learning analytics. Moreover, the review highlights the need to establish formalised guidelines to monitor the soundness, effectiveness, and legitimacy of learning analytics. As interest in learning analytics among higher education institutions continues to grow, this review will provide insights into policy and strategic planning for the adoption of learning analytics.

abstract={This paper focuses on the problem of identifying students, who are at risk of failing their course. The presented method proposes a solution in the absence of data from previous courses, which are usually used for training machine learning models. This situation typically occurs in new courses. We present the concept of a "self-learner" that builds the machine learning models from the data generated during the current course. The approach utilises information about already submitted assessments, which introduces the problem of imbalanced data for training and testing the classification models. There are three main contributions of this paper: (1) the concept of training the models for identifying at-risk students using data from the current course, (2) specifying the problem as a classification task, and (3) tackling the challenge of imbalanced data, which appears both in training and testing data. The results show the comparison with the traditional approach of learning the models from the legacy course data, validating the proposed concept. © 2017 ACM.},

First, it informs the instructors and students of the important topics in the course; without learning them properly students will not be successful. Second, it highlights any inconsistencies in defining the learning objective, how they are being assessed, and design of the course.

abstract={Advances in the learning analytics community have created opportunities to deliver early warnings that alert teachers and instructors when a student is at risk of not meeting academic goals [6], [71]. Alert systems have also been developed for school district leaders [33] and for academic advisors in higher education [39], but other professionals in the K-12 system, namely guidance counselors, have not been widely served by these systems. In this study, we use college enrollment models created for the ASSISTments learning system [55] to develop reports that target the needs of these professionals, who often work directly with students, but usually not in classroom settings. These reports are designed to facilitate guidance counselors' efforts to help students to set long term academic and career goals. As such, they provide the calculated likelihood that a student will attend college (the ASSISTments College Prediction Model or ACPM), alongside student engagement and learning measures. Using design principles from risk communication research and student feedback theories to inform a co-design process, we developed reports that can inform guidance counselor efforts to support student achievement. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={We investigate automatic detection of teacher questions from audio recordings collected in live classrooms with the goal of providing automated feedback to teachers. Using a dataset of audio recordings from 11 teachers across 37 class sessions, we automatically segment the audio into individual teacher utterances and code each as containing a question or not. We train supervised machine learning models to detect the human-coded questions using highlevel linguistic features extracted from automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, acoustic and prosodic features from the audio recordings, as well as context features, such as timing and turn-taking dynamics. Models are trained and validated independently of the teacher to ensure generalization to new teachers. We are able to distinguish questions and non-questions with a weighted F1 score of 0.69. A comparison of the three feature sets indicates that a model using linguistic features outperforms those using acoustic-prosodic and context features for question detection, but the combination of features yields a 5% improvement in overall accuracy compared to linguistic features alone. We discuss applications for pedagogical research, teacher formative assessment, and teacher professional development. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={This poster will be a chance for a wider LAK audience to engage with the 2nd LAK Failathon workshop. Both of these will build on the successful Failathon event in 2016 and extend beyond discussing individual experiences of failure to exploring how the field can improve, particularly regarding the creation and use of evidence. Failure in research is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile crises of confidence in the published research literature in medicine and psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings. These incentives prevent the field in general from learning from negative findings, and almost entirely preclude the publication of mistakes and errors. Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to learn from each other's failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants learn from each other's mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. The 2n LAK Failathon workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to learn from each other's failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base. This poster is an opportunity for wider feedback on the plans developed in the workshop, with interactive use of sticky notes to add new ideas and coloured dots to illustrate prioritisation. This broadens the participant base in this important work, which should improve the quality of the plans and the commitment of the community to delivering them. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The facilitation of interpersonal relationships within a respectful learning climate is an important aspect of teaching practice. However, in large-scale online contexts, such as MOOCs, the number of learners and highly asynchronous nature militates against the development of a sense of belonging and dyadic trust. Given these challenges, instead of conventional instruments that reflect learners' affective perceptions, we suggest a set of indicators that can be used to evaluate social activity in relation to the participation structure. These group-level indicators can then help teachers to gain insights into the evolution of social activity shaped by their facilitation choices. For this study, group-level indicators were derived from measuring information exchange activity between the returning MOOC posters. By conceptualizing this group as an identity-based community, we can apply exponential random graph modelling to explain the network's structure through the configurations of direct reciprocity, triadiclevel exchange, and the effect of participants demonstrating super-posting behavior. The findings provide novel insights into network amplification, and highlight the differences between the courses with different facilitation strategies. Direct reciprocation was characteristic of non-facilitated groups. Exchange at the level of triads was more prominent in highly facilitated online communities with instructor's involvement. Super-posting activity was less pronounced in networks with higher triadic exchange, and more pronounced in networks with higher direct reciprocity. © 2017 ACM.},

To address this challenge, we propose the use of EEG-based cognitive load detectors during learning. Despite its potential, EEG has not yet been utilized as a way to optimize instructional strategies. We take an initial step towards this goal by assessing how experimentally manipulated (easy and difficult) sections of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) influenced EEG-based estimates of students' cognitive load. We found a main effect of task difficulty on EEG-based cognitive load estimates, which were also correlated with learning performance. Our results show that EEG can be a viable source of data to model learners' mental states across a 90-minute session. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Automatic detection of public transport (PT) usage has important applications for intelligent transport systems. It is crucial for understanding the commuting habits of passengers at large and over longer periods of time. It also enables compilation of door-to-door trip chains, which in turn can assist public transport providers in improved optimisation of their transport networks. In addition, predictions of future trips based on past activities can be used to assist passengers with targeted information. This article documents a dataset compiled from a day of active commuting by a small group of people using different means of PT in the Helsinki region. Mobility data was collected by two means: (a) manually written details of each PT trip during the day, and (b) measurements using sensors of travellers’ mobile devices. The manual log is used to cross-check and verify the results derived from automatic measurements. The mobile client application used for our data collection provides a fully automated measurement service and implements a set of algorithms for decreasing battery consumption. The live locations of some of the public transport vehicles in the region were made available by the local transport provider and sampled with a 30-s interval. The stopping times of local trains at stations during the day were retrieved from the railway operator. The static timetable information of all the PT vehicles operating in the area is made available by the transport provider, and linked to our dataset. The challenge is to correctly detect as many manually logged trips as possible by using the automatically collected data. This paper includes an analysis of challenges due to missing or partially sampled information, and initial results from automatic recognition using a set of algorithms comparing measured trips with both live vehicle locations and static timetables. Improvement of correct recognitions is left as an ongoing challenge. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Current studies on churn prediction in telco apply network analytics to analyze and featurize call graphs. While the suggested approaches demonstrate a lot of creativity when it comes to deriving new features from the underlying networks, they also exhibit at least one of the following problems: they either do not account properly for dynamic aspects of call networks or they do not exploit the full potential of joint interaction and structural features and additionally, they usually address these in a non-systematic manner which involves hand-engineering of features. In this study, we propose a novel approach in which we address each of the identified issues. In a nutshell, first, we propose slicing a monthly call graph to capture dynamic changes in calling patterns. Second, we devise network designs which conjoin interaction and structural information. Third, we adapt and apply the node2vec method to learn node representations in a more automated way and to avoid the need for feature handcrafting. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Spectral graph wavelets introduce a notion of scale in networks, and are thus used to obtain a local view of the network from each node. By carefully constructing a wavelet filter function for these wavelets, a multi-scale community detection method for monoplex networks has already been developed. This construction takes advantage of the partitioning properties of the network Laplacian. In this paper we elaborate on a novel method which uses spectral graph wavelets to detect multi-scale communities in temporal networks. To do this we extend the definition of spectral graph wavelets to temporal networks by adopting a multilayer framework. We use arguments from Perturbation Theory to investigate the spectral properties of the supra-Laplacian matrix for clustering purposes in temporal networks. Using these properties, we construct a new wavelet filter function, which attenuates the influence of uninformative eigenvalues and centres the filter around eigenvalues which contain information on the coarsest description of prevalent community structures over time. We use the spectral graph wavelets as feature vectors in a connectivity-constrained clustering procedure to detect multi-scale communities at different scales, and refer to this method as Temporal Multi-Scale Community Detection (TMSCD). We validate the performance of TMSCD and a competing methodology on various benchmarks. The advantage of TMSCD is the automated selection of relevant scales at which communities should be sought. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={This paper is an ongoing work, and was presented as “Lightening Talk” in the DyNo workshop held at ECML/PKDD 2017. Online event-based social services allow users to organize social events by specifying the themes, and invite friends to participate social events. While the event information can be spread over the social network, it is expected that by certain communication between event hosts, users interested in the event themes can be as many as possible. In this work, by combining the ideas of team formation and influence maximization, we formulate a novel research problem, Influential Team Formation (ITF), to facilitate the organization of social events. Given a set L of required labels to describe the event topics, a social network, and the size k of the host team, ITF is to find a k-node set S that satisfying L and maximizing the Influence-Cost Ratio (i.e., the influence spread per communication cost between team members). Since ITF is proved to be NP-hard, we develop two greedy algorithms and one heuristic method to solve it. Extensive experiments conducted on Facebook and Google+ datasets exhibit the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods. In addition, by employing the real event participation data in Meetup, we show that ITF with the proposed solutions is able to predict organizers of influential events. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={We propose a methodology to anonymize microdata (i.e. a table of n individuals described by d attributes). The goal is to be able to release an anonymized data table built from the original data while meeting the differential privacy requirements. The proposed solution combines co-clustering with synthetic data generation to produce anonymized data. First, a data independent partitioning on the domains is used to generate a perturbed multidimensional histogram; a multidimensional co-clustering is then performed on the noisy histogram resulting in a partitioning scheme. This differentially private co-clustering phase aims to form attribute values clusters and thus, limits the impact of the noise addition in the second phase. Finally, the obtained scheme is used to partition the original data in a differentially private fashion. Synthetic individuals can then be drawn from the partitions. We show through experiments that our solution outperforms existing approaches and we demonstrate that the produced synthetic data preserve sufficient information and can be used for several datamining tasks. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Ever-increasing quantities of personal data are generated by individuals, knowingly or unconsciously, actively or passively (e.g., bank transactions, geolocations, posts on web forums, physiological measures captured by wearable sensors). Most of the time, this wealth of information is stored, managed, and valorized in isolated systems owned by private companies or organizations. Personal information management systems (PIMS) propose a groundbreaking counterpoint to this trend. They essentially aim at providing to any interested individual the technical means to re-collect, manage, integrate, and valorize his/her own data through a dedicated system that he/she owns and controls. In this vision paper, we consider personal preferences as first-class citizens data structures. We define and motivate the threefold preference elicitation problem in PIMS - elicitation from local personal data, elicitation from group preferences, and elicitation from user interactions. We also identify hard and diverse challenges to tackle (e.g., small data, context acquisition, small-scale recommendation, low computing resources, data privacy) and propose promising research directions. Overall, we hope that this paper uncovers an exciting and fruitful research track. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have changed the way people connect and interact with each other. Indeed, most people have registered an account on some popular OSNs (such as Facebook, or Google+) which is used to access the system at different times of the days, depending on their life and habits. In this context, understanding how users connect to the OSNs is of paramount importance for both the protection of their privacy and the OSN’s provider (or third-party applications) that want to exploit this information. In this paper, we study the task of predicting the availability status (online/offline) of the OSNs’ users by exploiting the availability information of their friends. The basic idea is to evaluate how the knowledge about availability status of friends can help in predicting the availability status of the center-users. For this purpose, we exploit several learning algorithms to find interesting relationships between the availability status of the users and those of their friends. The extensive validation of the results, by using a real Facebook dataset, indicates that the availability status of the users’ friends can help in predicting whether the central user is online or offline. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The soaring amount of data coming from a variety of sources including social networks and mobile devices opens up new perspectives while at the same time posing new challenges. On one hand, AI-systems like Neural Networks paved the way toward new applications ranging from self-driving cars to text understanding. On the other hand, the management and analysis of data that fed these applications raises concerns about the privacy of data contributors. One robust (from the mathematical point of view) privacy definition is that of Differential Privacy (DP). The peculiarity of DP-based algorithms is that they do not work on anonymized versions of the data; they add a calibrated amount of noise before releasing the results, instead. The goals of this paper are: to give an overview on recent research results marrying DP and neural networks; to present a blueprint for differentially private neural networks; and, to discuss our findings and point out new research challenges. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={In Facebook, the set of pages liked by some users represents an important knowledge about their real life tastes. However, the process of classification, which is already hard when dealing with dozens of classes and genres, is made even more difficult by the very coarse information of Facebook pages. Our work originates from a large dataset of pages liked by users of a Facebook app. To overcome the limitations of multilabel automatic classification of free-form user-generated pages, we acquire data also from IMDb, a large public database about movies. We use it to associate with high accuracy a given cinema-related page on Facebook to the corresponding record on IMDb, which includes plenty of metadata in addition to genres. To this aim, we compare different approaches. The obtained results demonstrate that the highest accuracy is obtained by the combined use of different methods and metrics. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

This experiment focuses on the groups of clustered relations that are formed within a user’s social data traces. Community extraction is a popular part of the analysis of social data. We have applied the technique of Markov Clustering to the Twitter networks of social actors. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that it is more effective than the Louvain method for finding social groups known to the subjects, while still being very simple to implement. We also demonstrate that traces of cell towers captured using our “MobileMiner” mobile application are sufficient to capture significant details about their social relations by the simple application of k-means. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

We deployed a mixed-methods approach that allowed us to generate an analysis framework that is theoretically robust, and generalizable. Additionally, the framework is grounded in data and hence applicable to real-life learning contexts. This paper presents how our framework was developed and how it can be used to analyse data.

abstract={Teaching analytics' is the application of learning analytics techniques to understand teaching and learning processes, and eventually enable supportive interventions. However, in the case of (often, half-improvised) teaching in face-to-face classrooms, such interventions would require first an understanding of what the teacher actually did, as the starting point for teacher reection and inquiry. Currently, such teacher enactment characterization requires costly manual coding by researchers. This paper presents a case study exploring the potential of machine learning techniques to automatically extract teaching actions during classroom enactment, from five data sources collected using wearable sensors (eye-tracking, EEG, accelerometer, audio and video). Our results highlight the feasibility of this approach, with high levels of accuracy in determining the social plane of interaction (90%, k=0.8). The reliable detection of concrete teaching activity (e.g., explanation vs. questioning) accurately still remains challenging (67%, k=0.56), a fact that will prompt further research on multimodal features and models for teaching activity extraction, as well as the collection of a larger multimodal dataset to improve the accuracy and generalizability of these methods. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Many pedagogical models in the field of learning analytics are implicit and do not overtly direct learner behavior. While this allows flexibility of use, this could also result in misaligned practice, and there are calls for more explicit pedagogical models in learning analytics. This paper presents an explicit pedagogical model, the Team and Self Diagnostic Learning (TSDL) framework, in the context of collaborative inquiry tasks. Key informing theories include experiential learning, collaborative learning, and the learning analytics process model. The framework was trialed through a teamwork competency awareness program for 14 year old students. A total of 272 students participated in the program. This paper foregrounds students' and teachers' evaluative accounts of the program. Findings reveal positive perceptions of the stages of the TSDL framework, despite identified challenges, which points to its potential usefulness for teaching and learning. The TSDL framework aims to provide theoretical clarity of the learning process, and foster alignment between learning analytics and the learning design. The current work provides trial outcomes of a teamwork competency awareness program that used dispositional analytics, and further efforts are underway to develop the discourse layer of the analytic engine. Future work will also be dedicated to application and refinement of the framework for other contexts and participants, both learners and teachers alike. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={When used effectively, reflective writing tasks can deepen learners' understanding of key concepts, help them critically appraise their developing professional identity, and build qualities for lifelong learning. As such, reflecting writing is attracting substantial interest from universities concerned with experiential learning, reflective practice, and developing a holistic conception of the learner. However, reflective writing is for many students a novel genre to compose in, and tutors may be inexperienced in its assessment. While these conditions set a challenging context for automated solutions, natural language processing may also help address the challenge of providing real time, formative feedback on draft writing. This paper reports progress in designing a writing analytics application, detailing the methodology by which informally expressed rubrics are modelled as formal rhetorical patterns, a capability delivered by a novel web application. This has been through iterative evaluation on an independently humanannotated corpus, showing improvements from the first to second version. We conclude by discussing the reasons why classifying reflective writing has proven complex, and reflect on the design processes enabling work across disciplinary boundaries to develop the prototype to its current state. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Differences in learners' behavior have a deep impact on their educational performance. Consequently, there is a need to detect and identify these differences and build suitable learner models accordingly. In this paper, we report on the results from an alternative approach for dynamic student behavioral modeling based on the analysis of time-based student-generated trace data. The goal was to unobtrusively classify students according to their time-spent behavior. We applied 5 different supervised learning classification algorithms on these data, using as target values (class labels) the students' performance score classes during a Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) process, and compared the obtained results. The proposed approach has been explored in a study with 259 undergraduate university participant students. The analysis of the findings revealed that a) the low misclassification rates are indicative of the accuracy of the applied method and b) the ensemble learning (treeBagger) method provides better classification results compared to the others. These preliminary results are encouraging, indicating that a time-spent driven description of the students' behavior could have an added value towards dynamically reshaping the respective models. © 2016 ACM.},

When controlled randomization is present in the learning platform, such as randomized ordering of problems within a problem set, natural quasi-randomized controlled studies can be conducted, post-hoc. Difficulty and learning gain attribution are among factors of interest that can be studied with secondary analyses under these conditions. However, much of the content that we might like to evaluate for learning value is not administered as a random stimulus to students but instead is being self-selected, such as a student choosing to seek help in the discussion forums, wiki pages, or other pedagogically relevant material in online courseware. Help seekers, by virtue of their motivation to seek help, tend to be the ones who have the least knowledge. When presented with a cohort of students with a bi-modal or uniform knowledge distribution, this can present problems with model interpretability when a single point estimation is used to represent cohort prior knowledge. Since resource access is indicative of a low knowledge student, a model can tend towards attributing the resources with low or negative learning gain in order to better explain performance given the higher average prior point estimate. In this paper we present several individualized prior strategies and demonstrate how learning efficacy attribution validity and prediction accuracy improve as a result. Level of education attained, relative past assessment performance, and the prior per student cold start heuristic were employed and compared as prior knowledge individualization strategies. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={An important research problem in learning analytics is to expedite the cycle of data leading to the analysis of student progress and the improvement of student support. For this goal in the context of social learning, we propose a pipeline that includes data infrastructure, learning analytics, and intervention, along with computational models for individual components. Next, we describe an example of applying this pipeline to real data in a case study, whose goal is to investigate the positive effects that goal-setting students have on their peers, which suggests ways in which we might foster these social benefits through intervention. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={An ongoing challenge for Learning Analytics research has been the scalable derivation of user interaction data from multiple technologies. The complexities associated with this challenge are increasing as educators embrace an ever grow- ing number of social and content-related technologies. The Experience API (xAPI) alongside the development of user specific record stores has been touted as a means to ad- dress this challenge, but a number of subtle considerations must be made when using xAPI in Learning Analytics. This paper provides a general overview to the complexities and challenges of using xAPI in a general systemic analytics solution - called the Connected Learning Analytics (CLA) toolkit. The importance of design is emphasised, as is the notion of common vocabularies and xAPI Recipes. Early decisions about vocabularies and structural relationships be- Tween statements can serve to either facilitate or handicap later analytics solutions. The CLA toolkit case study pro- vides us with a way of examining both the strengths and the weaknesses of the current xAPI specification, and we con- clude with a proposal for how xAPI might be improved by using JSON-LD to formalise Recipes in a machine readable form. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={How can we best align learning analytics practices with disciplinary knowledge practices in order to support student learning? Although learning analytics itself is an interdisciplinary field, it tends to take a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to the collection, measurement, and reporting of data, overlooking disciplinary knowledge practices. In line with a recent trend in higher education research, this paper considers the contribution of a realist sociology of education to the field of learning analytics, drawing on findings from recent student focus groups at an Australian university. It examines what learners say about their data needs with reference to organizing principles underlying knowledge practices within their disciplines. The key contribution of this paper is a framework that could be used as the basis for aligning the provision and/or use of data in relation to curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment with disciplinary knowledge practices. The framework extends recent research in Legitimation Code Theory, which understands disciplinary differences in terms of the principles that underpin knowledge-building. The preliminary analysis presented here both provides a tool for ensuring a fit between learning analytics practices and disciplinary practices and standards for achievement, and signals disciplinarity as an important consideration in learning analytics practices. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={When designing learning analytics tools for use by learners we have an opportunity to provide tools that consider a particular learner's situation and the learner herself. To afford actual impact on learning, such tools have to be informed by theories of education. Particularly, educational research shows that individual differences play a significant role in explaining students' learning process. However, limited empirical research in learning analytics has investigated the role of theoretical constructs, such as motivational factors, that are underlying the observed differences between individuals. In this work, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effect of three designed learning analytics visualizations on students' participation in online discussions in authentic course settings. Using hierarchical linear mixed models, our results revealed that effects of visualizations on the quantity and quality of messages posted by students with differences in achievement goal orientations could either be positive or negative. Our findings highlight the methodological importance of considering individual differences and pose important implications for future design and research of learning analytics visualizations. © 2016 ACM.},

The high volume, variety and velocity of collected data necessitate use of big data tools and storage systems such as distributed databases for storage and Apache Spark for analysis. This tutorial will introduce researchers and faculty to real- world applications involving data mining and predictive an- Alytics in learning sciences. In addition, the tutorial will introduce statistics required to validate and accurately re- port results. Topics will cover how big data is being used to transform education. Specifically, we will demonstrate how exploratory data analysis, data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques are being ap- plied to educational big data to improve learning and scale insights driven from millions of student's records. The tutorial will be held over a half day and will be hands on with pre-posted material. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of work, the tutorial appeals to researchers from a wide range of backgrounds including big data, predictive analytics, learning sciences, educational data mining, and in general, those interested in how big data analytics can transform learning.

abstract={Little is known about the processes institutions use when discerning their readiness to implement learning analytics. This study aims to address this gap in the literature by using survey data from the beta version of the Learning Analytics Readiness Instrument (LARI) [1]. Twenty-four institutions were surveyed and 560 respondents participated. Five distinct factors were identified from a factor analysis of the results: Culture; Data Management Expertise; Data Analysis Expertise; Communication and Policy Application; and, Training. Data were analyzed using both the role of those completing the survey and the Carnegie classification of the institutions as lenses. Generally, information technology professionals and institutions classified as Research Universities-Very High research activity had significantly different scores on the identified factors. Working within a framework of organizational learning, this paper details the concept of readiness as a reflective process, as well as how the implementation and application of analytics should be done so with ethical considerations in mind. Limitations of the study, as well as next steps for research in this area, are also discussed. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Our previous work has demonstrated that players who per- ceive a game as more challenging are likely to perceive greater learning from that game [8]. However, this may not be the case for all sources of challenge. In this study of a Science learning game called Quantum Spectre, we found thatstudents' progress through the first zone of the game seemed to encounter a \roadblock" during gameplay, dropping out when they cannot (or do not want to) progress further. Previously we had identified two primary types of errors in the learning game, Quantum Spectre: Science Errors related to the game's core educational content; and Puzzle Errors related to rules of the game but not to science knowledge. Using this prior analysis, alongside Survival Analysis techniques for analyzing time-series data and drop-out rates, we explored players' gameplay patterns to help us understand player dropout in Quantum Spectre. These results demonstrate that modeling player behavior can be useful for both assessing learning and for designing complex problem solving content for learning environments. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

We offer an approach that, in addition to providing visualisations of their learning, allows learners to propose changes to their learner model. This aims to help improve the accuracy of the learner model by taking into account student viewpoints on their learning, while also promoting learner reflection on their learning as part of a discussion of the content of their learner model. This aligns well with recent calls for learning analytics for learners. Building on previous research showing that learners will use open learner models, we here investigate their initial reactions to open learner model features to identify the likelihood of uptake in contexts where an open learner model is offered on an optional basis. We focus on university students' perceptions of a range of visualisations and their stated preferences for a facility to view evidence for the learner model data and to propose changes to the values. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the results of an exploratory study that examined the problem of automating content analysis of student online discussion transcripts. We looked at the problem of coding discussion transcripts for the levels of cognitive presence, one of the three main constructs in the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model of distance education. Using Coh-Metrix and LIWC features, together with a set of custom features developed to capture discussion context, we developed a random forest classification system that achieved 70.3% classification accuracy and 0.63 Cohen's kappa, which is significantly higher than values reported in the previous studies. Besides improvement in classification accuracy, the developed system is also less sensitive to overfitting as it uses only 205 classification features, which is around 100 times less features than in similar systems based on bag-of-words features. We also provide an overview of the classification features most indicative of the different phases of cognitive presence that gives an additional insights into the nature of cognitive presence learning cycle. Overall, our results show great potential of the proposed approach, with an added benefit of providing further characterization of the cognitive presence coding scheme. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Even though the recent influx of tablets in primary education goes together with the vision that educational technology empowered with learning analytics will revolutionize education, empirical results supporting this claim are scares. Adaptive educational technology Snappet combines extracted and embedded learning analytics daily in classrooms. While students make exercises on the tablet this technology displays real-time data of learner performance in a teacher dashboard (extracted analytics). At the same time, learner performance is used to adaptively adjust exercises to students' progress (embedded analytics). This quasiexperimental study compares the development of students' arithmetic skills over one schoolyear (grade 2 and 4) in a traditional paper based setting to learning with the adaptive educational technology Snappet. The results indicate that students in the Snappet condition make significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in grade 4. Moreover, in this grade students with a high ability level, benefit the most from working with this adaptive educational technology. Overall the development pattern of students with different abilities was more divergent in the AET condition compared to the control condition. These results indicate that adaptive educational technologies combining extracted and embedded learning analytics are indeed creating new education scenarios that contribute to personalized learning in primary education. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Much evaluation focuses on completion rates and/or participant satisfaction. Overall, MOOCs are ill-defined and researchers struggle with appropriate evaluation criteria beyond attrition rates. In this paper, we provide a brief history of MOOCs, a summary of some evaluation research, and we propose a new model for evaluation with an example from a previouslydelivered MOOC. Measurement of the MOOC success framework through four student satisfaction types is proposed in this paper with a model for informal learning satisfaction, one of the proposed types, theorized and tested. Results indicated theoretical underpinnings, while intended to improve instruction, might not have influenced the same satisfaction construct. Therefore, future research into alternative satisfaction factor models is needed. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={This study provides a conceptual framework how organizations may adopt evidence-based interventions at scale, and how institutions may evaluate the costs and benefits of such interventions. Building on a new conceptual model developed by the Open University UK (OU), we will analyse three case-studies of evidence-based interventions. By working with 90+ large-scale modules for a period of two years across the five faculties and disciplines within the OU, Analytics4Action provides a bottomup- Approach for working together with key stakeholders within their respective contexts. Using principles of embedded casestudy approaches by Yin [1], by comparing the learning behavior, satisfaction and performance of 11079 learners the findings indicated that each of the three learning designs led to satisfied students and average to good student retention. In the second part we highlighted that the three module teams made in-presentation interventions based upon real-time analytics, whereby initial user data indicated VLE behaviour in line with expectations. In 2-5 years, we hope that a rich, robust evidence-base will be presented to show how learning analytics can help teachers to make informed, timely and successful interventions that will help learners to achieve their learning outcomes. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The affordances of learning analytics (LA) are being increasingly harnessed to enhance 21st century (21C) pedagogy and learning. Relatively rare, however, are use cases and empirically based understandings of students' actual experiences with LA tools and environments at fostering 21C literacies, especially in secondary schooling and Asian education contexts. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by 1) presenting a first iteration design of a computer-supported collaborative critical reading and LA environment and its 16-week implementation in a Singapore high school; and 2) foregrounding students' quantitative and qualitative accounts of the benefits and problematics associated with this learning innovation. We focus the analytic lens on the LA dashboard components that provided visualizations of students' reading achievement, 21C learning dispositions, critical literacy competencies and social learning network positioning within the class. The paper aims to provide insights into the potentialities, paradoxes and pathways forward for designing LA that take into consideration the voices of learners as critical stakeholders. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the fnal analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dash-board design options. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Despite the mounting evidence supporting the role that goal setting has on the learning process, there seems to be only a handful of studies that directly investigate goal setting in the context of Learning Analytics (LA). Although investigations have incorporated elements of goal setting, the attention afforded to theory and operationalization have been modest. In this workshop we plan to position goal setting at the forefront of LA research. The workshop will serve as a venue to bring together researchers interested in advancing Goal Setting (GS) research in the LA field. Topics include: (1) GS theory and measurement; (2) analysis and visualization of GS data; (3) strategies for integrating GS in the learning experience; and (4) implementation of GS technologies. Participants who need tools to execute their GS ideas and those who already have tools and are exploring better ways to integrate a goal setting feature can gain a lot from this workshop. Moreover, participants will have the opportunity to contribute to the conceptualization and staging of GS ideas in LA research. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Research in formal education has repeatedly offered evidence of the importance of social interactions for student learning. However, it remains unclear whether the development of such interpersonal relationships has the same influence on learning in the context of large-scale open online learning. For instance, in MOOCs group members frequently change and the volume of interactions can quickly amass to chaos, therefore impeding an individual's propensity to foster meaningful relationships. This paper examined a MOOC for its potential to develop social processes. As it is exceedingly difficult to establish a relationship with somebody who seldom accesses a MOOC discussion, we singled out a cohort defined by its participants' regularity of forum presence. The study, analysed this 'cohort' and its development, in comparison to the entire MOOC learner network. Mixed methods of social network analysis (SNA), content analysis and statistical network modelling, revealed the potential for unfolding social processes among a more persistent group of learners in the MOOC setting. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={With the aim of better scaffolding discussion to improve learning in a MOOC context, this work investigates what kinds of discussion behaviors contribute to learning. We explored whether engaging in higher-order thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or focused attention to course materials. In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches. First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attribution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analysis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social oriented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology oriented topics. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The pervasive collection of data has opened the possibility for educational institutions to use analytics methods to improve the quality of the student experience. However, the adoption of these methods faces multiple challenges particularly at the course level where instructors and students would derive the most benefit from the use of analytics and predictive models. The challenge lies in the knowledge gap between how the data is captured, processed and used to derive models of student behavior, and the subsequent interpretation and the decision to deploy pedagogical actions and interventions by instructors. Simply put, the provision of learning analytics alone has not necessarily led to changing teaching practices. In order to support pedagogical change and aid interpretation, this paper proposes a model that can enable instructors to readily identify subpopulations of students to provide specific support actions. The approach was applied to a first year course with a large number of students. The resulting model classifies students according to their predicted exam scores, based on indicators directly derived from the learning design. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The proliferation of varied types of multi-user interactive surfaces (such as digital whiteboards, tabletops and tangible interfaces) is opening a new range of applications in face-to-face (f2f) contexts. They offer unique opportunities for Learning Analytics (LA) by facilitating multi-user sensemaking of automatically captured digital footprints of students' f2f interactions. This paper presents an analysis of current research exploring learning analytics associated with the use of surface devices. We use a framework to analyse our first-hand experiences, and the small number of related deployments according to four dimensions: The orchestration aspects involved; the phases of the pedagogical practice that are supported; the target actors; and the levels of iteration of the LA process. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) a synthesis of conclusions that identify the degree of maturity, challenges and pedagogical opportunities of the existing applications of learning analytics and interactive surfaces; and 2) an analysis framework that can be used to characterise the design space of similar areas and LA applications. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Prerequisite skill structures have been closely studied in past years leading to many data-intensive methods aimed at refining such structures. While many of these proposed methods have yielded success, defining and refining hierarchies of skill relationships are often difficult tasks. The relationship between skills in a graph could either be causal, therefore, a prerequisite relationship (skill A must be learned before skill B). The relationship may be noncausal, in which case the ordering of skills does not matter and may indicate that both skills are prerequisites of another skill. In this study, we propose a simple, effective method of determining the strength of pre-to-post-requisite skill relationships. We then compare our results with a teacher-level survey about the strength of the relationships of the observed skills and find that the survey results largely confirm our findings in the data-driven approach. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper describes the development and evaluation of an affect-aware intelligent support component that is part of a learning environment known as iTalk2Learn. The intelligent support component is able to tailor feedback according to a student's affective state, which is deduced both from speech and interaction. The affect prediction is used to determine which type of feedback is provided and how that feedback is presented (interruptive or non-interruptive). The system includes two Bayesian networks that were trained with data gathered in a series of ecologically-valid Wizard-of-Oz studies, where the effect of the type of feedback and the presentation of feedback on students' affective states was investigated. This paper reports results from an experiment that compared a version that provided affect-aware feedback (affect condition) with one that provided feedback based on performance only (non-affect condition). Results show that students who were in the affect condition were less bored and less off-task, with the latter being statically significant. Importantly, students in both conditions made learning gains that were statistically significant, while students in the affect condition had higher learning gains than those in the non-affect condition, although this result was not statistically significant in this study's sample. Taken all together, the results point to the potential and positive impact of affect-aware intelligent support. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The areas of educational data mining and learning analytics focus on the extraction of knowledge and actionable items from data sets containing detailed information about students. However, the potential impact from these techniques is increased when properly contextualized within a learning environment. More studies are needed to explore the connection between student interactions, approaches to learning, and academic performance. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is defined as the extent to which a student is able to motivationally, metacognitively, and cognitively engage in a learning experience. SRL has been the focus of research in traditional classroom learning and is also argued to play a vital role in the online or blended learning contexts. In this paper, we study how SRL affects students' online interactions with various learning activities and its influence in academic performance. The results derived from a naturalistic experiment among a cohort of first year engineering students showed that positive self-regulated strategies (PSRS) and negative self-regulated strategies (NSRS) affected both the interaction with online activities and academic performance. NSRS directly predicted academic outcomes, whereas PSRS only contributed indirectly to academic performance via the interactions with online activities. These results point to concrete avenues to promote self-regulation among students in this type of learning contexts. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={In this paper we discuss the results of a study of students' academic performance in first year general education courses. Using data from 566 students who received intensive academic advising as part of their enrollment in the institution's premajor/ general education program, we investigate individual student, organizational, and disciplinary factors that might predict a students' potential classification in an Early Warning System as well as factors that predict improvement and decline in their academic performance. Disciplinary course type (based on Biglan's [7] typology) was significantly related to a student's likelihood to enter below average performance classifications. Students were the most likely to enter a classification in fields like the natural science, mathematics, and engineering in comparison to humanities courses. We attribute these disparities in academic performance to disciplinary norms around teaching and assessment. In particular, the timing of assessments played a major role in students' ability to exit a classification. Implications for the design of Early Warning analytics systems as well as academic course planning in higher education are offered. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper explores a longitudinal approach to combining engagement, performance and social connectivity data from a MOOC using the framework of exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The idea is to model the social network in the discussion forum in a given week not only using performance (assignment scores) and overall engagement (lecture and discussion views) covariates within that week, but also on the same person-level covariates from adjacent previous and subsequent weeks. We find that over all eight weekly sessions, the social networks constructed from the forum interactions are relatively sparse and lack the tendency for preferential attachment. By analyzing data from the second week, we also find that individuals with higher performance scores from current, previous, and future weeks tend to be more connected in the social network. Engagement with lectures had significant but sometimes puzzling effects on social connectivity. However, the relationships between social connectivity, performance, and engagement weakened over time, and results were not stable across weeks. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Student mistakes are often not random but, rather, reflect thoughtful yet incorrect strategies. In order for educational technologies to make full use of students' performance data to estimate the knowledge of a student, it is important to model not only the conceptions but also the misconceptions that a student's particular pattern of successes and errors may indicate. The student models that drive the "outer loop" of Intelligent Tutoring Systems typically do not represent or track misconceptions. Here, we present a method of representing misconceptions in the Knowledge Component models, or Q-Matrices, that are used by student models to estimate latent knowledge. We show, in a case study on a fraction arithmetic dataset, that incorporating a misconception into the Knowledge Component model dramatically improves the overall model's fit to data. We also derive qualitative insights from comparing predicted learning curves across models that incorporate varying misconceptionrelated parameters. Finally, we show that the inclusion of a misconception in the Knowledge Component model can yield individual student estimates of misconception strength that are significantly correlated with out-of-tutor measures of student errors. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={This paper describes the analysis of the social and semantic structure of discussion forums in massive open online courses (MOOCs) in terms of information exchange and user roles. To that end, we analyse a network of forum users based on information-giving relations extracted from the forum data. Connection patterns that appear in the information exchange network of forum users are used to define specific user roles in a social context. Semantic roles are derived by identifying thematic areas in which an actor seeks for information (problem areas) and the areas of interest in which an actor provides information to others (expertise). The interplay of social and semantic roles is analysed using a socio-semantic blockmodelling approach. The results show that social and semantic roles are not strongly interdependent. This indicates that communication patterns and interests of users develop simultaneously only to a moderate extent. In addition to the case study, the methodological contribution is in combining traditional blockmodelling with semantic information to characterise participant roles. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The prevalence of early alert systems (EAS) at tertiary institutions is increasing. These systems are designed to assist with targeted student support in order to improve student retention. They also require considerable human and capital resources to implement, with significant costs involved. It is therefore an imperative that the systems can demonstrate quantifiable financial benefits to the institution. The purpose of this paper is to report on the financial implications of implementing an EAS at an Australian university as a case study. The case study institution implemented an EAS in 2011 using data generated from a data warehouse. The data set is comprised of 16,124 students enrolled between 2011 and 2013. Using a treatment effects approach, the study found that the cost of a student discontinuing was on average $4,687. Students identified by the EAS remained enrolled for longer, with the institution benefiting with approximately an additional $4,004 in revenue per student over the length of enrolment. All schools had a significant positive effect associated with the EAS and the EAS showed significant value to the institution regardless of the timing when the student was identified. The results indicate that EAS had significant financial benefits to this institution and that the benefits extended to the entire institution beyond the first year of enrolment. © 2016 ACM.},

While considerable work has studied the experiences of English language learners in different learning environments, we have yet to see analytics that detail the experiences of this population within formal and informal learning environments. This study used the experience sampling methodology to capture the information that is needed to detail the communication and affective experiences of advanced English language learners. The collected data reveals differences in how English language learners perceived their communication success based on their learning context, with higher levels of communicative success experienced in formal learning settings. No such differences were found for learners', highly negative, affect. The data suggest a need for additional emotional support within formal and informal learning environments as well as a need for oral communication support within informal contexts. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={In the context of MOOCs, "With-me-ness" refers to the extent to which the learner succeeds in following the teacher, specifically in terms of looking at the area in the video that the teacher is explaining. In our previous works, we employed eye-tracking methods to quantify learners' With-meness and showed that it is positively correlated with their learning gains. In this contribution, we describe a tool that is designed to improve With-me-ness by providing a visualaid superimposed on the video. The position of the visualaid is suggested by the teachers' dialogue and deixis, and it is displayed when the learner's With-me-ness is under the average value, which is computed from the other students' gaze behavior. We report on a user-study that examines the effectiveness of the proposed tool. The results show that it significantly improves the learning gain and it significantly increases the extent to which the students follow the teacher. Finally, we demonstrate how With-me-ness can create a complete theoretical framework for conducting gazebased learning analytics in the context of MOOCs. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The proposed framework incorporates various types of analyt- ics, with the teacher playing a key role in bringing context to the analysis and making decisions on the feedback pro- vided to students as well as the scaffolding and adaptation of the learning design. The framework consists of five di-mensions: Temporal analytics, tool-specific analytics, cohort dynamics, comparative analytics and contingency.

The present work employs a data mining approach on randomized controlled trial data from ASSISTments, a popular online learning platform, to assess the benefits of incorporating additional student performance data when attempting to differentiate between two user groups. Through a resampling technique, we show that partial credit, defined as an algorithmic combination of binary correctness, hint usage, and attempt count, can benefit assessment and group differentiation. Partial credit reduces sample sizes required to reliably differentiate between groups that are known to differ by 58%, and reduces sample sizes required to reliably differentiate between less distinct groups by 9%. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Content-related posts were defined as those that give/seek help for the learning of course material and share/comment on relevant resources. A linguistic model was built based on manually-coded starting posts in threads from a statistics MOOC (n=837) and tested on thread starting posts from the second offering of the same course (n=304) and a different statistics course (n=298). The number of views and votes threads received were tested to see if they helped classification. Results showed that content-related posts in the statistics MOOC had distinct linguistic features which appeared to be unrelated to the subject-matter domain; the linguistic model demonstrated good cross-course reliability (all recall and precision > .77) and was useful across all time segments of the courses; number of views and votes were not helpful for classification. © 2016 ACM.},

While course content and didactics of those massive courses are the primary key factors for the success of courses, still a smart platform may increase or decrease the learners experience and his learning outcome. The paper at hand proposes the usage of an A/B testing framework that is able to be used within an micro-service architecture to validate hypotheses about how learners use the platform and to enable data-driven decisions about new features and settings. To evaluate this framework three new features (Onboarding Tour, Reminder Mails and a Pinboard Digest) have been identified based on a user survey. They have been implemented and introduced on two large MOOC platforms and their inuence on the learners behavior have been measured. Finally this paper proposes a data driven decision workow for the introduction of new features and settings on e-learning platforms. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Journal writing is an important and common reflective practice in education. Students' reflection journals also offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, the analysis of the textual reflections in class of large size presents challenges. Automatic analysis of students' reflective writing holds great promise for providing adaptive real time support for students. This paper proposes a method based on topic modeling techniques for the task of themes exploration and reflection grade prediction. We evaluated this method on a sample of journal writings from pre-service teachers. The topic modeling method was able to discover the important themes and patterns emerged in students' reflection journals. Weekly topic relevance and word count were identified as important indicators of their journal grades. Based on the patterns discovered by topic modeling, prediction models were developed to automate the assessing and grading of reflection journals. The findings indicate the potential of topic modeling in serving as an analytic tool for teachers to explore and assess students' reflective thoughts in written journals. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative learning is considered a critical 21st century skill. Much is known about its contribution to learning, but still investigating a process of collaboration remains a challenge. This paper approaches the investigation on collaborative learning from a psychophysiological perspective. An experiment was set up to explore whether biosensors can play a role in analysing collaborative learning. On the one hand, we identified five physiological coupling indices (PCIs) found in the literature: 1) Signal Matching (SM), 2) Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM), 3) Directional Agreement (DA), 4) Pearson's correlation coeficient (PCC) and the 5) Fisher's z-transform (FZT) of the PCC. On the other hand, three collaborative learning measurements were used: 1) collaborative will (CW), 2) collaborative learning product (CLP) and 3) dual learning gain (DLG). Regression analyses showed that out of the five PCIs, IDM related the most to CW and was the best predictor of the CLP. Meanwhile, DA predicted DLG the best. These results play a role in determining informative collaboration measures for designing a learning analytics, biofeedback dashboard.},

Learning Analytics dashboards have been used at all levels, including institutional, regional and national level [2]. In classroom use, while learning visualisations are often based on counts of activity data or interaction patterns, there is increasing recognition that learning analytics relate to learning, and should therefore provide pedagogically useful information [3]. While increasing numbers of technology-enhanced learning applications are embracing the potential of learning analytics at the classroom level, often these are aimed at teachers. However, learners can also benefit from learning analytics data (e.g. [4][5]). © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The widespread adoption of Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) has somewhat stagnated recently, and in some prominent cases even been reversed following concerns by governments, stakeholders and civil rights groups about privacy and ethics applied to the handling of personal data. In this ongoing discussion, fears and realities are often indistinguishably mixed up, leading to an atmosphere of uncertainty among potential beneficiaries of Learning Analytics, as well as hesitations among institutional managers who aim to innovate their institution's learning support by implementing data and analytics with a view on improving student success. In this paper, we try to get to the heart of the matter, by analysing the most common views and the propositions made by the LA community to solve them. We conclude the paper with an eight-point checklist named DELICATE that can be applied by researchers, policy makers and institutional managers to facilitate a trusted implementation of Learning Analytics. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Writing training systems have been developed to provide students with instruction and deliberate practice on their writing. Although generally successful in providing accurate scores, a common criticism of these systems is their lack of personalization and adaptive instruction. In particular, these systems tend to place the strongest emphasis on delivering accurate scores, and therefore, tend to overlook additional indices that may contribute to students' success, such as their affective states during writing practice. This study takes an initial step toward addressing this gap by building a predictive model of students' affect using information that can potentially be collected by computer systems. We used individual difference measures, text indices, and keystroke analyses to predict engagement and boredom in 132 writing sessions. The results suggest that these three categories of indices were successful in modeling students' affective states during writing. Taken together, indices related to students' academic abilities, text properties, and keystroke logs were able classify high and low engagement and boredom in writing sessions with accuracies between 76.5% and 77.3%. These results suggest that information readily available in writing training systems can inform affect detectors and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={This workshop explores how data literacy impacts on learning analytics both for practitioners and for end users. The term data literacy is used to broadly describe the set of abilities around the use of data as part of everyday thinking and reasoning for solving real-world problems. It is a skill required both by learning analytics practitioners to derive actionable insights from data and by the intended end users, such that it affects their ability to accurately interpret and critique presented analysis of data. The latter is particularly important, since learning analytics outcomes can be targeted at a wide range of end users, some of whom will be young students and many of whom are not data specialists. Whilst data literacy is rarely an end goal of learning analytics projects, this workshop aims to find where issues related to data literacy have impacted on project outcomes and where important insights have been gained. This workshop will further encourage the sharing of knowledge and experience through practical activities with datasets and visualisations. This workshop aims to highlight the need for a greater understanding of data literacy as a field of study, especially with regard to communicating around large, complex, data sets. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in learning analytics (LA) in technology-enhanced learning (TEL). Generally, LA deals with the development of methods that harness educational data sets to support the learning process. Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and selfde fining the indicators that help them achieve their goals. In this paper, we address the challenge of personalized LA and present the conceptual, design, and implementation details of a rule-based indicator definition tool to support exible definition and dynamic generation of indicators to meet the needs of different stakeholders with diverse goals and questions in the LA exercise. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The majority of the learning analytics research focuses on the prediction of course performance and modeling student behaviors with a focus on identifying students who are at risk of failing the course. Learning analytics should have a stronger focus on improving the quality of learning for all students, not only identifying at risk students. In order to do so, we need to understand what successful patterns look like when reflected in data and subsequently adjust the course design to avoid unsuccessful patterns and facilitate successful patterns. However, when establishing these successful patterns, it is important to account for individual differences among students since previous research has shown that not all students engage with learning resources to the same extent. Regulation strategies seem to play an important role in explaining the different usage patterns students' display when using digital learning recourses. When learning analytics research incorporates contextualized data about student regulation strategies we are able to differentiate between students at a more granular level. The current study examined if regulation strategies could account for differences in the use of various learning resources. It examines how students regulated their learning process and subsequently used the different learning resources throughout the course and established how this use contributes to course performance. The results show that students with different regulation strategies use the learning resources to the same extent. However, the use of learning resources influences course performance differently for different groups of students. This paper recognizes the importance of contextualization of learning data resources with a broader set of indicators to understand the learning process. With our focus on differences between students, we strive for a shift within learning analytics from identifying at risk students towards a contribution of learning analytics in the educational design process and enhance the quality of learning; for all students. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Completion rates for massive open online classes (MOOCs) are notoriously low. Identifying student patterns related to course completion may help to develop interventions that can improve retention and learning outcomes in MOOCs. Previous research predicting MOOC completion has focused on click-stream data, student demographics, and natural language processing (NLP) analyses. However, most of these analyses have not taken full advantage of the multiple types of data available. This study combines click-stream data and NLP approaches to examine if students' on-line activity and the language they produce in the online discussion forum is predictive of successful class completion. We study this analysis in the context of a subsample of 320 students who completed at least one graded assignment and produced at least 50 words in discussion forums, in a MOOC on educational data mining. The findings indicate that a mix of clickstream data and NLP indices can predict with substantial accuracy (78%) whether students complete the MOOC. This predictive power suggests that student interaction data and language data within a MOOC can help us both to understand student retention in MOOCs and to develop automated signals of student success. © 2016 ACM.},

With more than ten thousand questions in both English and Chinese, the system has attracted nearly five thousand learners who have made about half a million question answering records. In an effort towards delivering personalized learning experience to the learners, this study aims to discover potentially useful knowledge from learners' reading and question answering records in the Reading Battle system, by applying association rule mining and clustering analysis. The results show that learners could be grouped into three clusters based on their self-reported reading habits. The rules mined from different learner clusters can be used to develop personalized recommendations to the learners.

We use natural language processing techniques to evaluate whether text analysis of open responses questions about motivation and utility value can offer additional capacity to predict persistence and completion over and above information obtained from fixed-response items. Compared to simple benchmarks based on demographics, we find that a machine learning prediction model can learn from unstructured text to predict which students will complete an online course. We show that the model performs well out-of-sample, compared to a standard array of demographics.

abstract={Educational institutions are evolving away from the oneapplication- fits-all learning management system to a loosely connected digital learning ecosystem comprising diverse services that increasingly leverage data analytics to drive pedagogical innovation. Yet an ecosystem rich in services but lacking a common approach to measuring learning activity will find data collection, aggregation and analysis time-consuming and costly. The IMS Caliper AnalyticsTM specification addresses the need for data and semantic interoperability by providing an extensible information model, controlled vocabularies and an API for instrumenting learning applications and systems that log learning events. However, many learning activities have yet to be modeled by the Caliper working group. Engaging the SoLAR community directly in this effort will help ensure that the needs of researchers and other consumers of learning analytics data will inform future versions of the specification. The LAK16 Caliper workshop is being offered with this goal in mind. The half-day session, facilitated by members of Team Caliper, will provide LAK16 participants with an opportunity to extend the Caliper specification by modeling new learning activity profiles. New profiles, new connections and new friendships are expected outcomes. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The "doer effect" is an association between the number of online interactive practice activities students' do and their learning outcomes that is not only statistically reliable but has much higher positive effects than other learning resources, such as watching videos or reading text. Such an association suggests a causal interpretation-more doing yields better learning-which requires randomized experimentation to most rigorously confirm. But such experiments are expensive, and any single experiment in a particular course context does not provide rigorous evidence that the causal link will generalize to other course content. We suggest that analytics of increasingly available online learning data sets can complement experimental efforts by facilitating more widespread evaluation of the generalizability of claims about what learning methods produce better student learning outcomes. We illustrate with analytics that narrow in on a causal interpretation of the doer effect by showing that doing within a course unit predicts learning of that unit content more than doing in units before or after. We also provide generalizability evidence across four different courses involving over 12,500 students that the learning effect of doing is about six times greater than that of reading. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Despite the prevalence of e-learning systems in schools, most of today's systems do not personalize educational data to the individual needs of each student. This paper proposes a new algorithm for sequencing questions to students that is empir- ically shown to lead to better performance and engagement in real schools when compared to a baseline approach. It is based on using knowledge tracing to model students' skill acquisition over time, and to select questions that advance the student's learning within the range of the student's ca- pabilities, as determined by the model. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model that incorporates partial credit scores, reasoning about multiple attempts to solve problems, and integrating item dificulty. This model is shown to outperform other BKT models that do not reason about (or reason about some but not all) of these features. The model was incorporated into a sequenc- ing algorithm and deployed in two classes in different schools where it was compared to a baseline sequencing algorithm that was designed by pedagogical experts. In both classes, students using the BKT sequencing approach solved more dificult questions and attributed higher performance than did students who used the expert-based approach. Students were also more engaged using the BKT approach, as deter- mined by their interaction time and number of log-ins to the system, as well as their reported opinion. We expect our approach to inform the design of better methods for se- quencing and personalizing educational content to students that will meet their individual learning needs. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={As the field of learning analytics continues to mature, there is a corresponding evolution and sophistication of the associated analytical methods and techniques. In this regard social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as one of the cornerstones of learning analytics methodologies. However, despite the noted importance of social networks for facilitating the learning process, it remains unclear how and to what extent such network measures are associated with specific learning outcomes. Motivated by Simmel's theory of social interactions and building on the argument that social centrality does not always imply benefits, this study aimed to further contribute to the understanding of the association between students' social centrality and their academic performance. The study reveals that learning analytics research drawing on SNA should incorporate both - descriptive and statistical methods to provide a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of a students' network position. In so doing researchers can undertake more nuanced and contextually salient inferences about learning in network settings. Specifically, we show how differences in the factors framing students' interactions within two instances of a MOOC affect the association between the three social network centrality measures (i.e., degree, closeness, and betweenness) and the final course outcome. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Methods that accurately predict the grade of a student at a given activity or course can identify students that are at risk in failing a course and allow their educational institution to take corrective actions. Though a number of prediction models have been developed, they either estimate a single model for all students based on their past course performance and interactions with learning management systems (LMS), or estimate student-specific models that do not take into account LMS interactions; thus, failing to exploit fine-grain information related to a student's engagement. In this work we present a class of collaborative multi-regression models that are personalized to each student and also take into account features related to student's past performance, engagement and course characteristics. These models use all historical information to estimate a small number of regression models shared by all students along with student-specific combination weights. This allows for information sharing and also generating personalized predictions. Our experimental evaluation on a large set of students, courses, and activities shows that these models are capable of improving the performance prediction accuracy by over 20%. In addition, we show that by analyzing the estimated models and the student-specific combination functions we can gain insights on the effectiveness of the educational material that is made available at the courses of different departments.},

abstract={Tertiary institutions are increasing the emphasis on generating, collecting and analyzing student data as a means of targeting student support services. This study utilizes a data set from a regional Australian university to conduct logistic regression analyzing the student enrollment outcomes. The results indicate that demographic factors have a minor effect while institutional and learning environment variables play a more significant role in determining student enrollment outcomes. Using grade distribution compared to grade point average provides better estimates as to the effect particular grades have on enrollment outcomes. Moreover, the effect of an early alert system on enrollment outcomes shows that early identification has a significant relationship to a student's choice to stay enrolled versus discontinuing, lapsing or being inactive in their enrollment. These results are vital in the targeting of student support services at the case study institution. The significant results indicate the importance of learning environment variables in understanding student enrollment outcomes at tertiary institutions. This analysis forms part of a much larger research project analyzing student retention at the institution.},

abstract={A vast amount of OpenCourseWare (OCW) is meanwhile being published online to make educational content accessible to larger audiences. The awareness of such courses among users and the popularity of systems providing such courses are increasing. However, from a subjective experience, OCW is frequently cursory, outdated or non-reusable. In order to obtain a better understanding of the quality of OCW, we assess the quality in terms of fitness for use. Based on three OCW use case scenarios, we define a range of dimensions according to which the quality of courses can be measured. From the definition of each dimension a comprehensive list of quality metrics is derived. In order to obtain a representative overview of the quality of OCW, we performed a quality assessment on a set of 100 randomly selected courses obtained from 20 different OCW repositories. Based on this assessment we identify crucial areas in which OCW needs to improve in order to deliver up to its promises.},

This paper offers a unique perspective by applying techniques from social network analysis to eye movement patterns in mathematics problem solving. We construct and visualize transition networks using eye-tracking data collected from 37 8th grade students while solving linear function problems. By applying network analysis on the constructed transition networks, we find general transition patterns between areas of interest (AOIs) for all students, and we also compare patterns for high-and low-performing students. Our results show that even though students share general transition patterns during problem solving, high-performing students made more strategic transitions among AOI triples than low-performing students. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={While substantial progress has been made in terms of predictive modeling in the Learning Analytics Knowledge (LAK) community, one element that is often ignored is the role of learning design. Learning design establishes the objectives and pedagogical plans which can be evaluated against the outcomes captured through learning analytics. However, no empirical study is available linking learning designs of a substantial number of courses with usage of Learning Management Systems (LMS) and learning performance. Using cluster- and correlation analyses, in this study we compared how 87 modules were designed, and how this impacted (static and dynamic) LMS behavior and learning performance. Our findings indicate that academics seem to design modules with an "invisible" blueprint in their mind. Our cluster analyses yielded four distinctive learning design patterns: constructivist, assessment-driven, balanced-variety and social constructivist modules. More importantly, learning design activities strongly influenced how students were engaging online. Finally, learning design activities seem to have an impact on learning performance, in particular when modules rely on assimilative activities. Our findings indicate that learning analytics researchers need to be aware of the impact of learning design on LMS data over time, and subsequent academic performance.},

abstract={A main goal for learning analytics is to inform the design of a learning experience to improve its quality. The increasing presence of solutions based on big data has even questioned the validity of current scientific methods. Is this going to happen in the area of learning analytics? In this paper we postulate that if changes are driven solely by a digital footprint, there is a risk of focusing only on factors that are directly connected to numeric methods. However, if the changes are complemented with an understanding about how students approach their learning, the quality of the evidence used in the redesign is significantly increased. This reasoning is illustrated with a case study in which an initial set of activities for a first year engineering course were shaped based only on the student's digital footprint. These activities were significantly modified after collecting qualitative data about the students approach to learning. We conclude the paper arguing that the interpretation of the meaning of learning analytics is improved when combined with qualitative data which reveals how and why students engaged with the learning tasks in qualitatively different ways, which together provide a more informed basis for designing learning activities.},

For example we already know that students who game the system in middle school mathematics are less likely to major in science or technology, but what majors are they more likely to select? Using data from 356 college students who used the ASSISTments system during their middle school years, we find significant differences in student knowledge, performance and off-task and gaming behaviors between students who eventually choose different college majors.},

Extending this research, this study examines whether sequences of socially regulated learning differ across low, medium or high performing groups. Scaffolded by a computer avatar, 54 primary school students (working in 18 groups of 3) discussed writing a report about a foreign country for 51,338 turns. Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) of these sequences of talk showed that in high performing groups, high cognition was preceded more often by high cognition and less often by denials or low cognition. In medium performing groups, high cognition was preceded more often by high cognition or planning. As these results indicate that different sequences among students' cognitive, metacognitive and relational activities are linked to levels of performance, they can inform a micro-temporal theory of socially shared regulation.},

abstract={We have developed a novel data-driven mastery learning system to improve learning in complex procedural problem solving domains. This new system was integrated into an existing logic proof tool, and assigned as homework in a deductive logic course. Student performance and dropout were compared across three systems: The Deep Thought logic tutor, Deep Thought with integrated hints, and Deep Thought with our data-driven mastery learning system. Results show that the data-driven mastery learning system increases mastery of target tutor-actions, improves tutor scores, and lowers the rate of tutor dropout over Deep Thought, with or without provided hints.},

abstract={As Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) becomes increasingly adopted as an alternative to classic educational scenarios, we face an increasing need for automatic tools designed to support tutors in the time consuming process of analyzing conversations and interactions among students. Therefore, building upon a cohesion-based model of the discourse, we have validated ReaderBench, a system capable of evaluating collaboration based on a social knowledge-building perspective. Through the inter-twining of different participants' points of view, collaboration emerges and this process is reflected in the identified cohesive links between different speakers. Overall, the current experiments indicate that textual cohesion successfully detects collaboration between participants as ideas are shared and exchanged within an ongoing conversation.},

In this paper we argue that MOOCs which have open entry and open curriculum structures, place pressure on learners to not only have the requisite knowledge and skills to complete the course, but also the skills to traverse the course in adaptive ways that lead to success. The empirical study presented in the paper investigated the degree to which students' prior knowledge and skills, and their engagement with the MOOC as measured through learning analytics, predict end-of-MOOC performance. The findings indicate that prior knowledge is the most significant predictor of MOOC success followed by students' ability to revise and revisit their previous work.},

abstract={To better model students' learning, user modelling should be able to use the detailed sequence of student actions to model student knowledge, not just their right/wrong scores. Our goal is to analyze the question: "Does it matter when a hint is used?". We look at students who use identical attempt counts to get the right answer and look for the impact of help use and action order on future performance. We conclude that students who use hints too early do worse than students who use hints later. However, students who use hints, at times, may perform as well as students who do not use hints. This paper makes a novel contribution showing for the first time that paying attention to the precise sequence of hints and attempts allows better prediction of students' performance, as well as to definitively show that, when we control for the number of attempts and hints, students that attempt problems before asking for hints show higher performance on the next question. This analysis shows that the pattern of hints and attempts, not just their numbers, is important.},

Using the method enables us to compare courses across universities. Through an analysis of course syllabi distribution, we found that CS2013 uniformly covered a wide area of computer science. Some universities emphasized human factors, while others attached greater importance to theoretical ones. We also found that some CS departments offered not only a CS curriculum but also an electrical engineering one, and those departments showed a tendency to have more "Architecture and Organization (AR)" related curricula. Furthermore, we found that even though "Information Assurance and Security (IAS)" has not yet become a very popular field, some universities are already offering IAS related courses.},

Approaches to ability estimation with respect to both of these issues are considered using data from a large-enrollment electrical engineering MOOC. The allowance of unlimited multiple attempts sets up a range of observed score and latent-variable approaches to scoring the constructed response homework. With respect to missing data, two classical approaches are discussed, treating omitted items as incorrect or missing at random (MAR). These treatments turn out to have slightly different interpretations depending on the scoring model. In all, twelve different homework scores are proposed based on combinations of scoring model and missing data handling. The scores are computed and correlations between each score and the final exam score are compared, with attention to different populations of course participants.},

The study of common and consequential sequences of events (such as learners accessing resources, interacting with other learners and engaging in self-regulatory activities) and how these are associated with learning outcomes, as well as the ways in which knowledge and skills grow or evolve over time are both core areas of interest. Learning analytics datasets are replete with fine-grained temporal data: click streams; chat logs; document edit histories (e.g. wikis, etherpads); motion tracking (e.g. eye-tracking, Microsoft Kinect), and so on. However, the emerging area of temporal analysis presents both technical and theoretical challenges in appropriating suitable techniques and interpreting results in the context of learning. The learning analytics community offers a productive focal ground for exploring and furthering efforts to address these challenges.

abstract={Learning analytics is a broad church that incorporates a range of topics and methodologies. As the field has developed some tension has emerged regarding a perceived contradiction between the implied constructivist ethos of the field and prevalent empirical practices that have been characterised as 'behaviourist' and 'positivist'. This paper argues that this tension is a sign of deeper metatheoretical faultlines that have plagued the social sciences more broadly. Critical realism is advanced as a philosophy of science that can help reconcile the apparent contradictions between the constructivist aims and the empirical practices of learning analytics and simultaneously can justify learning analytics' current methodological tolerance. The paper concludes that learning analytics, arrayed in realist terms, is essentially longitudinal and multimethodological, concerned with the socio-technical systems of learning and the problems of implementation, and has the potential to be emancipatory. Some methodological implications for learning analytics practice are discussed.},

abstract={All forms of learning take time. There is a large body of research suggesting that the amount of time spent on learning can improve the quality of learning, as represented by academic performance. The wide-spread adoption of learning technologies such as learning management systems (LMSs), has resulted in large amounts of data about student learning being readily accessible to educational researchers. One common use of this data is to measure time that students have spent on different learning tasks (i.e., time-on-task). Given that LMS systems typically only capture times when students executed various actions, time-on-task measures are estimated based on the recorded trace data. LMS trace data has been extensively used in many studies in the field of learning analytics, yet the problem of time-on-task estimation is rarely described in detail and the consequences that it entails are not fully examined. This paper presents the results of a study that examined the effects of different time-on-task estimation methods on the results of commonly adopted analytical models. The primary goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the issue of accuracy and appropriateness surrounding time-estimation within the broader learning analytics community, and to initiate a debate about the challenges of this process. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of time-on-task estimation methods in educational and related research fields.},

abstract={This paper describes a method of the visualization and analysis for mining useful learning logs from numerous learning experiences that learners have accumulated in the real world as the ubiquitous learning logs. Ubiquitous Learning Log (ULL) is defined as a digital record of what learners have learned in the daily life using ubiquitous technologies. It allows learners to log their learning experiences with photos, audios, videos, location, RFID tag and sensor data, and to share and reuse ULL with others. By constructing real-world corpora which comprise of accumulated ULLs with information such as what, when, where, and how learners have learned in the real world and by analyzing them, we can support learners to learn more effectively. The proposed system will predict their future learning opportunities including their learning patterns and trends by analyzing their past ULLs. The prediction is made possible both by network analysis based on ULL information such as learners, knowledge, place and time and by learners' self-analysis using time-map. By predicting what they tend to learn next in their learning paths, it provides them with more learning opportunities. Accumulated data are so big and the relationships among the data are so complicated that it is difficult to grasp how closely the ULLs are related each other. Therefore, this paper proposes a system to help learners to grasp relationships among learners, knowledge, place and time, using network graphs and network analysis. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Writing researchers have suggested that students who are perceived as strong writers (i.e., those who generate texts that are rated as high quality) demonstrate flexibility in their writing style. While anecdotally this has been a commonly held belief among researchers, scientists, and educators, there is little empirical research to support this claim. This study investigates this hypothesis by examining how students vary in their use of linguistic features across 16 prompt-based essays. Forty-five high school students wrote 16 essays across 8 sessions within an Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) system. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Entropy analyses were used to calculate how rigid or flexible students were in their use of narrative linguistic features over time and how this trait related to individual differences in literacy ability and essay quality. Additional analyses indicated that NLP and Entropy reliably detected narrative flexibility (or rigidity) after session 2 and was related to students' prior literacy skills. These exploratory methodologies are important for researchers and educators, as they indicate that writing flexibility is indeed a trait of strong writers and can be detected rather quickly using the combination of textual features and dynamic analyses.},

abstract={Cognitive disequilibrium has received significant attention for its role in fostering student learning in intelligent tutoring systems and in complex learning environments. In this paper, we both add to and extend this discussion by analyzing the emergence of four affective states associated with disequilibrium: joy, surprise, neutrality and confusion; in a collaborative hands-on, engineering design task. Specifically, we conduct a comparison between two learning strategies to make salient how the strategies are associated with different affective states. This comparison is grounded in the construction of a probabilistic model of student affective state as defined by the frequency of each state, and the rate of transition between affective states. Through this comparison we confirm prior research that highlights the importance of confusion as a marker of knowledge construction, but put to question the notion that surprise is a significant mediator of cognitive disequilibrium. Overall, we show how modeling learner affect is useful for understanding and improving learning in complex, hands-on learning environments. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The Xerox Ignite™ Educator Support System (henceforth referred to simply as Ignite™) is a data collection, analysis, and visualization workflow and software solution to assist K-12 educators. To illustrate, suppose a third-grade teacher wants to know how well her class has grasped a lesson on fractions. She would first scan her students' homework and/or exams into the Ignite system via a range of multifunctional input devices. Xerox Ignite™ reads, interprets, and analyzes the students' work in minutes. Then the teacher can select how to view the data by choosing from numerous reports. Examples are; an "at a glance" class summary that shows who needs extra help in what areas and who is ready to move on; a "context" report showing how each skill for each student is progressing over time; a grade-level performance report that helps third-grade teachers share best practices and cluster students into learning groups; and a student feedback report that tells each student what he/she needs to improve upon. Ignite™ intent is also to make it easier for districts to administer, score and evaluate content based on academic goals set for schools and students. The scanning and 'mark lifting' technology embedded into Ignite™ reduces the time needed to correct papers and frees time for the teacher to apply detailed insights to their day-to-day instruction tasks. Critical to this function is the automated reading of student marks, including handwriting, to enable the digitization of student performance at a detailed level. In this paper we present a system level description of the Ignite™ handwriting recognition module and describe the challenges and opportunities presented in an educational environment.},

Currently, the system evaluates students' self-explanation performance using a local, sentence-level algorithm and does not adapt content based on reading ability. The current study leverages natural language processing tools to build models of students' comprehension ability from the linguistic properties of their self-explanations. Students (n = 126) interacted with iSTART across eight training sessions where they self-explained target sentences from complex science texts. Coh-Metrix was then used to calculate the linguistic properties of their aggregated self-explanations. The results of this study indicated that the linguistic indices were predictive of students' reading comprehension ability, over and above the current system algorithms. These results suggest that natural language processing techniques can inform stealth assessments and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems.},

abstract={As part of normal interpersonal communication, people send and receive messages with their body, especially with their hands. Gestures play an important role in teacher-student classroom interactions. In the domain of education, many research projects have focused on the study of such gestures either in real classrooms or in tutorial settings with experienced teachers. Novice teachers especially need to understand the messages they are sending through nonverbal communication as this can have a major effect on their ability to manage behaviors and deliver content. Such learning should optimally occur before experiencing the real classroom. To assist in this process, we have developed a virtual classroom environment-TeachLivE-and used it for teacher practice, reflection and assessment. This paper investigates the way teachers use gestures in the virtual classroom settings of TeachLivE. Biology and algebra teachers were evaluated in our study. Analysis of video recordings from real and virtual environment seems to indicate that algebra teachers gesture significantly more often than biology teachers. These results have implications for providing useful feedback to participant teachers. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

It reports findings from a study of whether and how MOOC log file data can assist in understanding how MOOC participants use (often) messy, chaotic forums to support complex, unpredictable, contingent learning processes. It is argued that descriptions of posting, voting and viewing behaviours do not in and of themselves provide insights about how learning is generated in MOOC forums. Rather, it is hypothesised that there is a skill involved in using forums to learn; that theory-informed descriptions of this skill illustrate how MOOC participants use forums differently as they progress from novice to expert; that the skill progression can be validated through the use of forum log file data; and that log file data can also be used to assess an individual MOOC participant's position in relation to this progression - that is, to measure an individual's skill in learning through forums and similar educational settings. These hypotheses were examined using data drawn from forums in a large MOOC run at the University of Melbourne in 2013.},

abstract={The Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model is a popular model used for tracking student progress in learning systems such as an intelligent tutoring system. However, the model is not free of problems. Well-recognized problems include the identifiability problem and the empirical degeneracy problem. Unfortunately, these problems are still poorly understood and how they should be dealt with in practice is unclear. Here, we analyze the mathematical structure of the BKT model, identify a source of the difficulty, and construct a simple Monte Carlo BKT model to analyze the problem in real data. Using the student activity data obtained from the ramp task module at the Concord Consortium, we find that the Monte Carlo BKT analysis is capable of detecting the identifiability problem and the empirical degeneracy problem, and, more generally, gives an excellent summary of the student learning data. In particular, the student activity monitoring parameter M emerges as the central parameter.},

The course was started by 160 students and completed by 60, with relatively extensive instructor interaction with individual learners. This yielded much higher levels of engagement and learning than are typical of open or conventional online courses. The course was further refined and offered a second time in 2014, where it was started by 76 students and completed by 22, with a much lower level of support. Comparable levels of engagement and learning were obtained, suggesting that this participatory approach to learning and assessment can indeed be managed with more typical instructor support. Nonetheless, additional automation and streamlining is called for if the model is to eventually be used in massive online courses with thousands of students or as an autonomous self-paced open course.},

abstract={We introduce a new grading system, the Cloud Teaching Assistant System (CTAS), as an additional element to instructor grading, peer grading and automated validation in massive open online courses (MOOCs). The grading distributions of the different approaches are compared in an experiment consisting of 476 exam participants. 25 submissions were graded by all four methods. 451 submissions were graded only by peer grading and automated validation. The results of the experiment suggest that both CTAS and peer grading do not simulate instructor grading (Pearson's correlations: 0.36, 0.39). If the CTAS and not the instructor is assumed to deliver accurate grading, peer grading is concluded to be a valid grading method (Pearson's correlation: 0. 76).},

abstract={Gameful course designs require a significant shift in approach for both students and instructors. Transforming a standard course into a good game involves fundamentally altering how the course functions, most notably by giving students greater control over their work. We have developed an application, GradeCraft, to support this shift in pedagogy. A key feature of the application is the Grade Predictor, where students can explore coursework options and plan pathways to success. We observed students in two gameful courses with differing designs using the Grade Predictor in similar ways: they spent similar amounts of time per session, increased usage when assignments were due and before making significant course decisions, predicted different types of assignments at different rates, and made more predictions in preparation for the end of semester. This study describes how students plan their coursework using the GradeCraft Grade Predictor tool.},

abstract={Optimizing the harvesting and analysis of student data promises to clear the fog surrounding the key drivers of student success and retention, and provide potential for improved student success. At the same time, concerns are increasingly voiced around the extent to which individuals are routinely and progressively tracked as they engage online. The Internet, the very thing that promised to open up possibilities and to break down communication barriers, now threatens to narrow it again through the panopticon of mass surveillance. Within higher education, our assumptions and understanding of issues surrounding student attitudes to privacy are influenced both by the apparent ease with which the public appear to share the detail of their lives and our paternalistic institutional cultures. As such, it can be easy to allow our enthusiasm for the possibilities offered by learning analytics to outweigh consideration of issues of privacy. This paper explores issues around consent and the seemingly simple choice to allow students to opt-in or opt-out of having their data tracked. We consider how 3 providers of massive open online courses (MOOCs) inform users of how their data is used, and discuss how higher education institutions can work toward an approach which engages and more fully informs students of the implications of learning analytics on their personal data.},

abstract={The higher education sector has seen a shift in teaching approaches over the past decade with an increase in the use of video for delivering lecture content as part of a flipped classroom or blended learning model. Advances in video technologies have provided opportunities for students to now annotate videos as a strategy to support their achievement of the intended learning outcomes. However, there are few studies exploring the relationship between video annotations, student approaches to learning, and academic performance. This study seeks to narrow this gap by investigating the impact of students' use of video annotation software coupled with their approaches to learning and academic performance in the context of a flipped learning environment. Preliminary findings reveal a significant positive relationship between annotating videos and exam results. However, negative effects of surface approaches to learning, cognitive strategy use and test anxiety on midterm grades were also noted. This indicates a need to better promote and scaffold higher order cognitive strategies and deeper learning with the use of video annotation software.},

An experimental design was used with half of the students randomly assigned to receive these interventions via email and the other half being analyzed for at-risk triggers but receiving no intervention. Pre-course surveys on student motivation [4] and prior subject matter knowledge were conducted, and students were asked to maintain weekly logs of their activity online and offline connected to the courses. Regression analyses, incorporating feature selection methods to account for student demographic data, were used to compare the impact of the interventions between the control and experimental groups. Results showed that the interventions were associated with a higher final grade in one course, but only for a particular demographic group. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Creating meaning from a wide variety of available information and being able to choose what to learn are highly relevant skills for learning in a connectivist setting. In this work, various approaches have been utilized to gain insights into learning processes occurring within a network of learners and understand the factors that shape learners' interests and the topics to which learners devote a significant attention. This study combines different methods to develop a scalable analytic approach for a comprehensive analysis of learners' discourse in a connectivist massive open online course (cMOOC). By linking techniques for semantic annotation and graph analysis with a qualitative analysis of learner-generated discourse, we examined how social media platforms (blogs, Twitter, and Facebook) and course recommendations influence content creation and topics discussed within a cMOOC. Our findings indicate that learners tend to focus on several prominent topics that emerge very quickly in the course. They maintain that focus, with some exceptions, throughout the course, regardless of readings suggested by the instructor. Moreover, the topics discussed across different social media differ, which can likely be attributed to the affordances of different media. Finally, our results indicate a relatively low level of cohesion in the topics discussed which might be an indicator of a diversity of the conceptual coverage discussed by the course participants.},

We demonstrate the use of third-party datasets to enrich demographic portraits of MOOC students and answer fundamental questions about SES and MOOC enrollment. We derive demographic information from registrants' geographic location by matching self-reported mailing addresses with data available from Esri at the census block group level and the American Community Survey at the zip code level. We then use these data to compare neighborhood income and parental education for US registrants in HarvardX courses to the US population as a whole. Overall, HarvardX registrants tend to reside in more affluent neighborhoods. Registrants on average live in neighborhoods with median incomes approximately .45 standard deviations higher than the US population. Higher levels of parental education are also associated with a higher likelihood of registration.},

abstract={A monitoring system that does not disturb learners' motivation and attention is important, especially in online learning with massive numbers of participants. We propose a learning system, called the finger trail learning system (FTLS), that can monitor participants' learning attitude by means of their finger movements. On the display of the FTLS, letters are presented with low contrast in the initial state, and the contrast of the letters changes to high when they are traced by learners. We implemented the FTLS as an iOS application and confirmed that the software can be utilized to monitor learners' attitudes. In addition, we compared trails of finger movements between participants with high and low performance. The results show that the trail of finger movements recorded by the FTLS can be an index of learners' attitudes. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained attention recently because of their great potential to reach learners. Substantial empirical study has focused on student persistence and their interactions with the course materials. However, most MOOCs include a rich textual dialogue forum, and these textual interactions are largely unexplored. Automatically understanding the nature of discussion forum posts holds great promise for providing adaptive support to individual students and to collaborative groups. This paper presents a study that applies unsupervised student understanding models originally developed for synchronous tutorial dialogue to MOOC forums. We use a clustering approach to group similar posts, compare the clusters with manual annotations by MOOC researchers, and further investigate clusters qualitatively. This paper constitutes a step toward applying unsupervised models to asynchronous communication, which can enable massive-scale automated discourse analysis and mining to better support students' learning.},

abstract={An interactive learning task was designed in a game format to help high school students acquire knowledge about a simple mechanical system involving a car moving on a ramp. This ramp game consisted of five challenges that addressed individual knowledge components with increasing difficulty. In order to investigate patterns of knowledge emergence during the ramp game, we applied the Monte Carlo Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm to 447 game segments produced by 64 student groups in two physics teachers' classrooms. Results indicate that, in the ramp game context, (1) the initial knowledge and guessing parameters were significantly highly correlated, (2) the slip parameter was interpretable monotonically, (3) low guessing parameter values were associated with knowledge emergence while high guessing parameter values were associated with knowledge maintenance, and (4) the transition parameter showed the speed of knowledge emergence. By applying the k-means clustering to ramp game segments represented in the three dimensional space defined by guessing, slip, and transition parameters, we identified seven clusters of knowledge emergence. We characterize these clusters and discuss implications for future research as well as for instructional game design.},

abstract={Designing, deploying and validating learning analytics tools for instructors or students is a challenge requiring techniques and methods from different disciplines, such as software engineering, human-computer interaction, educational design and psychology. Whilst each of these disciplines has consolidated design methodologies, there is a need for more specific methodological frameworks within the cross-disciplinary space defined by learning analytics. In particular there is no systematic workflow for producing learning analytics tools that are both technologically feasible and truly underpin the learning experience. In this paper, we present the LATUX workflow, a five-stage workflow to design, deploy and validate awareness tools in technology-enabled learning environments. LATUX is grounded on a well-established design process for creating, testing and re-designing user interfaces. We extend this process by integrating the pedagogical requirements to generate visual analytics to inform instructors' pedagogical decisions or intervention strategies. The workflow is illustrated with a case study in which collaborative activities were deployed in a real classroom.},

abstract={Supporting learning with rich natural language dialogue has been the focus of increasing attention in recent years. Many adaptive learning environments model students' natural lan- guage input, and there is growing recognition that these systems can be improved by leveraging multimodal cues to understand learners better. This paper investigates multi- modal features related to posture and gesture for the task of classifying students' dialogue acts within tutorial dialogue. In order to accelerate the modeling process by eliminating the manual annotation bottleneck, a fully unsupervised ma- chine learning approach is utilized for this task. The results indicate that these unsupervised models are significantly improved with the addition of automatically extracted posture and gesture information. Further, even in the absence of any linguistic features, a model that utilizes posture and gesture features alone performed significantly better than a majority class baseline. This work represents a step toward achieving better understanding of student utterances by incorporating multimodal features within adaptive learning environments. Additionally, the technique presented here is scalable to very large student datasets.},

In contrast, proactive remediation is a teacher-driven activity that occurs outside of the system, and its occurrence is not necessarily related to the student's current task within the Reasoning Mind system.

abstract={When assessing student essays, educators look for the students' ability to present and pursue well-reasoned and strong arguments. Such scholarly argumentation is often articulated by rhetorical metadiscourse. Educators will be necessarily examining metadiscourse in students' writing as signals of the intellectual moves that make their reasoning visible. Therefore students and educators could benefit from available powerful automated textual analysis that is able to detect rhetorical metadiscourse. However, there is a need to validate such technologies in higher education contexts, since they were originally developed in noneducational applications. This paper describes an evaluation study of a particular language analysis tool, the Xerox Incremental Parser (XIP), on undergraduate social science student essays, using the mark awarded as a measure of the quality of the writing. As part of this exploration, the study presented in this paper seeks to assess the quality of the XIP through correlational studies and multiple regression analysis.},

However, there was also evidence of uncertain interpretation both in terms of the format of the visualization of the feedback and their inability to understand the connection between the feedback and their current strategies.

abstract={Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are now being used across the world to provide millions of learners with access to education. Many learners complete these courses successfully, or to their own satisfaction, but the high numbers who do not finish remain a subject of concern for platform providers and educators. In 2013, a team from Stanford University analysed engagement patterns on three MOOCs run on the Coursera platform. They found four distinct patterns of engagement that emerged from MOOCs based on videos and assessments. However, not all platforms take this approach to learning design. Courses on the FutureLearn platform are underpinned by a social-constructivist pedagogy, which includes discussion as an important element. In this paper, we analyse engagement patterns on four FutureLearn MOOCs and find that only two clusters identified previously apply in this case. Instead, we see seven distinct patterns of engagement: Samplers, Strong Starters, Returners, Mid-way Dropouts, Nearly There, Late Completers and Keen Completers. This suggests that patterns of engagement in these massive learning environments are influenced by decisions about pedagogy. We also make some observations about approaches to clustering in this context.},

abstract={Widespread adoption of learning analytics for risk prediction faces different challenges at low-income secondary schools than at post-secondary institutions, where such methods have been more widely adopted. To leverage the benefits of learning analytics for under-resourced communities, educators must overcome the barriers to adoption faced by local schools: internet access, data integration, data interpretation, and local alignment. We present the case study of an enhanced reporting tool for parents and teachers, the Bridge Report, locally designed to meet the needs of a low-income secondary school in New York City. Parent and Teacher focus groups suggest that addressing local obstacles to learning analytics can create conditions for enthusiastic adoption by parents and teachers. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Learning analytics (LA) has invested much effort in the investigation of students' behavior and performance within learning systems. This paper expands the influence of LA to students' behavior outside of learning systems and describes a novel machine learning model which automatically detects students' off-task behavior as students interact with a learning system, ASSISTments, based solely on log file data. We first operationalize social cognitive theory to introduce two new variables, affect states and problem set, both of which can be automatically derived from the logs, and can be considered to have a major influence on students' behavior. These two variables further work as the feature vector data for a K-means clustering algorithm in order to quantify students' different behavioral characteristics. This quantified variable representing student behavior type expands the feature space and contributes to the improvement of the various model performance compared with only time- and performance-related features. In addition, an advanced Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) algorithm is coded for off-task behavior detection and to show the best performance compared with traditional modeling techniques. Implications of the study are then discussed.},

In this paper, we explore the role of multimodal analysis in the service of studying complex learning environments. We compare uni-modal and multimodal; manual and semiautomated methods for examining how students learn in a handson, engineering design context. Specifically, we compare human annotations, speech, gesture and electro-dermal activation data from a study (N=20) where student participating in two different experimental conditions. The experimental conditions have already been shown to be associated with differences in learning gains and design quality. Hence, one objective of this paper is to identify the behavioral practices that differed between the two experimental conditions, as this may help us better understand how the learning interventions work. An additional objective is to provide examples of how to conduct learning analytics research in complex environments and compare how the same algorithm, when used with different forms of data can provide complementary results.},

abstract={Traditional practices of spacing and expanding retrieval practices have typically fixed their spacing intervals to one or few predefined schedules [5, 7]. Few have explored the advantages of using personalized expanding intervals and scheduling systems to adapt to the knowledge levels and learning patterns of individual students. In this work, we are concerned with estimating the effects of personalized expanding intervals on improving students' long-term mastery level of skills. We developed a Personalized Adaptive Scheduling System (PASS) in ASSISTments' retention and relearning workflow. After implementing the PASS, we conducted a study to investigate the impact of personalized scheduling on long-term retention by comparing results from 97 classes in the summer of 2013 and 2014. We observed that students in PASS outperformed students in traditional scheduling systems on long-term retention performance (p = 0.0002), and that in particular, students with medium level of knowledge demonstrated reliable improvement (p = 0.0209) with an effect size of 0.27. In addition, the data we gathered from this study also helped to expose a few issues we have with the new system. These results suggest personalized knowledge retrieval schedules are more effective than fixed schedules and we should continue our future work on examining approaches to optimize PASS.},

The Traces framework identifies observable contingencies between events and uses these to build more abstract models of interaction and ties represented as graphs. Applications are illustrated to identification of sessions and key participants in the sessions, relations between sessions as mediated by participants, and longer-term participant roles. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

In this work we discuss the types of tutoring environments that are best modeled by interaction networks, and how the empirical observations of problem-solving result in common network features. We find that interaction networks exhibit the properties of scale-free networks such as vertex degree distributions that follow power law. We compare data from two versions of a propositional logic tutor, as well as two different representations of data from an educational game on programming. We find that statistics such as degree as-sortativity and the scale-free metric allow comparison of the network structures across domains, and provide insight into student problem solving behavior.},

abstract={Empirical evidence contained in open digital badges has the capability to change educational curricula, assessments, and priorities. Because badge data in educational, social media, and workforce contexts is publicly available, questions of privacy and ethics should be scrutinized. Due to change driven by digital transparency, ethical questions at the intersection of learning analytics and the data contained in badges poses three distinct, yet related questions: within learning analytics systems, can the use of educational data in digital badges be used in a predictive manner to create a deterministic future for individual learners? Can badge data that is freely and openly accessible in social media be used against individuals if it exposes intellectual weaknesses? And, can the student data in badges be isolated to exploit particular skills for nefarious reasons, i.e. surveillance or hacking? These questions address ethical principles of human autonomy, freedom, and determinism. Copyright © by the paper's authors.},

abstract={Web-enabled digital badges are quickly transforming the way that individual and collaborative learning is supported, recognized, and assessed in digital learning contexts. Badges contain specific claims and evidence supporting those claims and they have the potential to also transform the way that researchers study learning. Because digital badges are so new, there are few examples or models for studying them or using them to study learning. This paper introduces six research designs for studying learning with digital badges that emerged in a study of thirty projects funded to develop digital badges in a 2012 competition. These principles distinguish between summative, formative, and "transformative" research, and between using conventional forms of evidence and using the evidence contained in digital badges.

The core of the SAGRADA model is a set of metrics, carefully developed for specific practical application cases following well-known pedagogical approaches. The metrics enable measuring and tracking learners' efforts in developing their soft skills. The paper also presents a specific application case based on the SAGRADA model, including the preliminary results of the first observational study, and plans for applying learning analytics methods and techniques in further activities of the GRASS project.

Teacher Learning Journeys was designed for personalized science learning for educators in K-12 schools, museums, universities, and teaching colleges through employing two levels of micro-credentials: lower achievement digital stamps and higher achievement digital badges. Researchers conducted a qualitative collective case study centered on 36 teachers; the primary data were records from learners' interactions within the digital badge system; secondary data came from a survey at the end of the experience and two interviews with 11 focal teachers. Findings suggest the following design principles: (a) two levels of assessment can support personalized learning, (b) mastery of learning can be demonstrated and assessed through reflective logs, (c) collaboration during and after badging activities can provide value to the learners, and (d) establishment of relevance of badging experiences can support the application of content outside the badging system.

Badges can, they claim, recognize and credential learning acquired outside the confines of formal schooling, are widely available and affordable, will appeal to employers for their granular measurement of what individuals know and, more importantly, can do, are modular and stackable, and offer individualized and personalized learning. Sociological theory and research, however, offer grounds for caution in expecting digital badges to empower learners in the ways badge "evangelists" envision. In this presentation I will sketch constraints with which badge advocates may have to contend. These constraints include how credentials operate in labor markets and in the organization of work, the enduring power of conventional education forms, the contradictory position of profit-making firms in the education field, the exclusion of "powerful knowledge" from the learning outcomes afforded by badges, and the congruence between badges and neo-liberalism. To accomplish their vision of truly empowering learners, badge advocates will have to find ways to overcome the constraints I identify. Copyright © by the paper's authors.

abstract={Digital badging is becoming more popular in an assortment of disciplines, both academic and professional. Along with the success of practical badging initiatives, badging research is also moving at a rapid pace, a rate of change that may be intimidating to the uninitiated wishing to study them. However, there is a great need for additional research in light of the complexity of badging and the many contexts in which badging occurs. This paper outlines an approach to designing research studies around digital badges to assist researchers who are new to the field and looking to contribute. It begins by discussing how to form relevant research questions and how to approach the literature review, providing useful references as starting points. It then continues on to experimental design recommendations, discusses useful practices during experimentation, and concludes with recommendations for data analysis. Additionally, this paper describes challenges that are specific to badging and places them in context of the research design process. Multiple examples are provided to clarify these concepts.

Both use a set of pseudo-points in combination with spatio-temporal kernel density estimation. The first, weightextrapolating approach, uses regression on the weights of stationarylocated pseudo-points.

abstract={Evaluation of balance stability in elderly people is of prominent relevance in the field of health monitoring. Recently, the use of Wii Balance Board has been proposed as valid alternative to clinical balance tests, such as the widely used Berg Balance Scale (BBS) test, allowing to measure and analyze static features such as the duration or the speed of assessment of patients' center of pressure. In an innovative way, in this paper we propose to take into consideration the whole temporal information generated by the balance board, analyzing it by means of dynamical neural networks. In particular, using Recurrent Neural Networks implemented according to the Reservoir Computing paradigm, we propose to estimate the BBS score from the temporal data generated by the execution of one simple exercise on the balance board. Preliminary experimental assessments of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset show promising results. Copyright © 2015 for This Paper by Its Authors.},

abstract={The choice of an appropriate representation remains crucial for mining time series, particularly to reach a good trade-off between the dimensionality reduction and the stored information. Symbolic representations constitute a simple way of reducing the dimensionality by turning time series into sequences of symbols. SAXO is a data-driven symbolic representation of time series which encodes typical distributions of data points. This approach was first introduced as a heuristic algorithm based on a regularized coclustering approach. The main contribution of this article is to formalize SAXO as a hierarchical coclustering approach. The search for the best symbolic representation given the data is turned into a model selection problem. Comparative experiments demonstrate the benefit of the new formalization, which results in representations that drastically improve the compression of data.

This method allows not only removing the effect of specific components, but studying the components of interest with more detail.

In order to examine the effect of such assumptions we introduce two regularisation schemes that encourage piecewise constant structure within Gaussian graphical models.

abstract={Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is considered as a robust measure to compare numerical time series when some time elasticity is required. Even though its initial formulation can be slow, extensive research has been conducted to speed up the calculations. However, those optimizations are not always available for multidimensional time series. In this paper, we focus on time series describing gesture movement, all of which are multidimensional. Our approch propose to speed up the processing by 1. adaptively downsampling the time series into sparse time series and 2. generalizing DTW into a version exploiting sparsity. Furthermore, the downsampling algorithm doesn't need to know the whole timeseries to function, making it a good candidate for streaming applications such as real-time gesture recognition.

These data are collected for billing purposes but also to get analytical insights. Our main goal here is to build an understandable model able to explain the electric consumption patterns regarding several features. We chose to use decision tree models as they are easily comprehensible and have already been parallelized with success. In our industrial context, we often have to work on electrical time-series where the target to predict is neither a label (classification) nor a numerical value (regression) but a time-series representing a load curve. Therefore we use a different split criterion to separate time-series: the inertia. We also need a dedicated method for categorical features since the standard implementation would not work for time-series. This method is based on a hierarchical clustering in order to have a good trade-off between the computational complexity and the exploration of the possible bi-partition splits. We demonstrate the performance of our implementation on datasets with different sizes (up to a terabyte). Copyright © 2015 for This Paper by Its Authors.},

Based on the provided datasets on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) and Educational Data Mining (EDM), we enriched the data with geospatial locations of research institutes, topics extracted from papers, and the expertise of researchers. The interactive modules of the Web portal are then designed and implemented using the enriched RDF data. The implemented modules can be divided into two groups. The first group is concerned with providing dynamic and interactive visualization of the data, such as the modules of Conference Participants and Reference Map. The modules in the second group are designed for more advanced analysis and discovery of new knowledge, such as the modules of Scholar Similarity and Reviewer Recommendation. The modules have been designed following a loosely coupled, modular infrastructure, and can be easily migrated and reused in other projects.

abstract={The current version's rules for detecting contingencies try to form a balance between sophistication and simplicity. Typing mistakes are quite common in text chats, yet they are not corrected. Additionally, in order to measure similarity between posts only a removal of stop words and a stemmer are applied. Further lemmatization, e.g. by WordNet [5], might improve the detection of semantic cohesion, yet could also increase the risk of erroneously detected contingencies. In order to avoid such false contingencies, simplicity was chosen over sophistication in this case. As workflows in the analysis workbench are based on a modular concept and the technical platform supports adding additional features to it easily, variations of workflows are encouraged. The workflow presented here could be modified by adding new input components (e.g. for newsgroup dumps), analysis components (e.g. for pattern detection), or new output components (e.g. alternative visualizations, reports or graph formats). In future works linguistic features such as coreference resolution could help detecting and filtering existing contingencies. So far text chats without any explicit threading information have been analyzed. However, it could be interesting to incorporate user generated threading information such as it is given in forums or newsgroups. In these systems it is often only allowed to explicitly reference one other message, but by using lexical coherence, author name referencing and syntactical patterns, further dependencies might be detected.

abstract={The question posed by the 2014 LAK Data Challenge is "What do analytics on learning analytics tell us?" The authors looked to take a two-pronged approach to this challenge. First, the authors wanted to use advanced analytical techniques on the corpus to make the "eat your own dog food" point. Since many of the EDM/LAK submissions explain advanced statistical or semantic analytic approaches, we wanted to utilize those same methods for our analysis. To that end, we used two natural language processing (NLP) tools to analyze the corpus of papers. First we used Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract clusters of terms from the content. Second, we used Turbo Topics to convert the LDA output into phrases (bi-grams and tri-grams). The use of these NLP tools allowed us to execute the second part of our approach to the challenge. Once the corpus was aggregated as topics, we used Tableau to visually inspect the corpus for trends. In addition to standard descriptive visualizations, we were able to identify trends in the corpus topics from 2008 through 2013. Most interesting is that with both EDM and LAK, we noticed a trend of topic convergence after three years. Also, we were able to easily discern topic trends such as the increased popularity of "social" and "network," over the last three years, and the consistent appearance of 'Cognitive Tutor' related topics (e.g. intelligent tutoring, concept map). While these findings may not be unexpected, we believe that the ability to extract and visualize these outcomes is unique. Copyright © 2014 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.},

abstract={To the new international students who learn Japanese out-class in Japan, it is too hard to find different suitable ways for different students that have different learning characteristics. This paper considers to solve this problem, which is how to help new international students who learn Japanese for out-class learning according student's own learning frequency. This paper uses learning frequency as the point to understand students' learning behavior characteristics so that distinguish among different learning characteristics. The proposal algorithm in this paper helps international students to find similar students who have the similar information background and similar learning characteristics, and then recommends the new student suitable learning contents. To achieve the goal, this paper uses learning analytics method based on SCROLL system. This paper uses kmeans clustering to build student learning frequency model, and predict the relationship between user information and frequency model by classification. After finding the similar student for new student, the system will recommend learning content what the similar have learned to the new student. This paper compares the difference among Bayesian Network, C4.5 and Neural Network in our program. Copyright © 2014 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.},

abstract={This paper proposes how to enhance sharing knowledge among science communicators (SCs) in a museum. Our approach is to use SCROLL system to share learning log, which is defined as a digital record of what learners have learned in the daily life using ubiquitous technologies. One of the important skills of SCs is to create mutual communication with visitors and motivate them to know more. However, they have to acquire this skill from the daily experiences because this skill is not shared among SCs. Also, this skill is not easily taken over because the employment term of SCs is 5 years. In this situation, SCs registers learning logs into SCROLL and their activities are also recorded into video. They have a reflection session using learning logs and video in a week. Both interaction analysis by the expert and data analysis using SCROLL are combined.

abstract={Learning in social settings is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple processes at individual and collective levels of agency. Thus, a richer understanding of learning in socio-technical networks will be furthered by analytic methods that can move between and coordinate analyses of individual, small group and network level phenomena. This paper outlines our implementation of an analytic framework intended to address these and other needs (e.g., integrating fragmented traces of activity into one analytic artifact), and gives an example using data from the Tapped In educator professional network. The methods build on empirical relationships between events to build a graph of uptake relations-how one event builds on another, which are then used to identify sessions in the space-time dimensions of a rich online environment, identify key actors within sessions using sociometrics, and find relationships between sessions that might be vectors for the transmission of ideas or practices.

We show that as the analytics workbench already supports a wide range of analyses like network analysis, statistical analysis, and analysis of activity logs, the main effort needed for connecting a learning platform to it lies in transporting the log data of the platform into the workbench. However the analytics workbench is also designed for extensibility so if desired more specific analysis capabilities can be added to it easily. We present an analysis of the online platform of the KOLEGEA research project for supporting medical doctors in their specialty training as a case example for how the integration can be done, for what kind of analyses can be conducted, and for how the analysis results can help both the developers and the operators of such a learning platform.

Our results demonstrate the potentials of proposed approach; The developed classifier achieved 58.4% accuracy and Cohen's Kappa of 0.41 for the 5-category classification task. In this paper we analyze different classification features and describe the main problems and lessons learned from the development of such a system.

We show that both methods are a valid approach to modelling student activities. An advantage of the Markov chain-based approach is in its graphical output and in the possibility to model time dependencies of the student activities.

The overview also suggests a positive relation between posting in the discussion forum and, both, engagement and performance. The theory of speech acts is used to capture the role(s) played by posts. The results suggest that globally strong students tend to have a role of help-givers, and weak students a role of help-seekers, though giving help and seeking help among strong students could be balanced.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the patterns of design choices made by classroom teachers for decorating their classroom walls, using cluster analysis to see which design decisions go together. Classroom visual design has been previously studied, but not in terms of the systematic patterns adopted by teachers in selecting what materials to place on classroom walls, or in terms of the actual semantic content of what is placed on walls. This is potentially important, as classroom walls are continuously seen by students, and form a continual off-task behavior option, available to students at all times. Using the k-means clustering algorithm, we find four types of visual classroom environments (one of them an outlier within our data set), representing teachers' strategies in classroom decoration. Our results indicate that the degree to which teachers place content-related decorations on the walls, is a feature of particular importance for distinguishing which approach teachers are using. Similarly, the type of school (e.g. whether private or charter) appeared to be another significant factor in determining teachers' design choices for classroom walls. The present findings begin the groundwork to better understand the impact of teacher decisions and choices in classroom design that lead to better outcomes in terms of engagement and learning, and finally towards developing classroom designs that are more effective and engaging for learners.

abstract={To statistically model large data sets of knowledge processes during asynchronous, online forums, we must address analytic difficulties involving the whole data set (missing data, nested data and the tree structure of online messages), dependent variables (multiple, infrequent, discrete outcomes and similar adjacent messages), and explanatory variables (sequences, indirect effects, false positives, and robustness). Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) addresses all of these issues, as shown in an analysis of 1,330 asynchronous messages written and selfcoded by 17 students during a 13-week online educational technology course. The results showed how attributes at multiple levels (individual and message) affected knowledge creation processes. Men were more likely than women to theorize. Asynchronous messages created a micro-sequence context; opinions and asking about purpose preceded new information; anecdotes, opinions, different opinions, elaborating ideas, and asking about purpose or information preceded theorizing. These results show how informal thinking precedes formal thinking and how social metacognition affects knowledge creation. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={Learning analytics (LA) as a field remains in its infancy. Many of the techniques now prominent from practitioners have been drawn from various fields, including HCI, statistics, computer science, and learning sciences. In order for LA to grow and advance as a discipline, two significant challenges must be met: 1) development of analytics methods and techniques that are native to the LA discipline, and 2) practitioners in LA to develop algorithms and models that reflect the social and computational dimensions of analytics. This workshop introduces researchers in learning analytics to machine learning (ML) and the opportunities that ML can provide in building next generation analysis models.

In this study, we investigate the potential differential effects of text-based and image-based student learning activities on student learning outcomes in a functional anatomy course. When controlling for demographics and prior GPA, participation in in-class image-based activities is significantly correlated with performance on associated exam questions, while text-based engagement is not. Additionally, students rated activities as helpful for seeing images of key ideas and as being significantly less mentally taxing than text-based activities.

abstract={Understanding the behavior of learners within learning applications and analyzing the factors that may influence the learning process play a key role in designing and optimizing learning applications. In this work we focus on a specific application named "1x1 trainer" that has been designed for primary school children to learn one digit multiplications. We investigate the database of learners' answers to the asked questions (N > 440000) by applying the Markov chains. We want to understand whether the learners' answers to the already asked questions can affect the way they will answer the subsequent asked questions and if so, to what extent. Through our analysis we first identify the most difficult and easiest multiplications for the target learners by observing the probabilities of the different answer types. Next we try to identify influential structures in the history of learners' answers considering the Markov chain of different orders. The results are used to identify pupils who have difficulties with multiplications very soon (after couple of steps) and to optimize the way questions are asked for each pupil individually.

abstract={As providers of higher education begin to harness the power of big data analytics, one very fitting application for these new techniques is that of predicting student attrition. The ability to pinpoint students who might soon decide to drop out1 of a given academic program allows those in charge to not only understand the causes for this undesired outcome, but it also provides room for the development of early intervention systems. While making such inferences based on academic performance data alone is certainly possible, we claim that in many cases there is no substantial correlation between how well a student performs and his or her decision to withdraw. This is specially true when the overall set of students has a relatively similar academic performance. To address this issue, we derive measurements of engagement from students' electronic portfolios and show how these features can be effectively used to augment the quality of predictions.

abstract={In the last five years, the world has seen a remarkable level of interest in Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs. A consistent message from universities participating in MOOC delivery is their eagerness to understand students' online learning processes. This paper reports on an exploratory investigation of students' learning processes in two MOOCs which have different curriculum and assessment designs. When viewed through the lens of common MOOC learning analytics, the high level of initial student interest and, ultimately, the high level of attrition, makes these two courses appear very similar to each other, and to MOOCs in general. With the goal of developing a greater understanding of students' patterns of learning behavior in these courses, we investigated alternative learning analytic approaches and visual representations of the output of these analyses. Using these approaches we were able to meaningfully classify student types and visualize patterns of student engagement which were previously unclear. The findings from this research contribute to the educational community's understanding of students' engagement and performance in MOOCs, and also provide the broader learning analytics community with suggestions of new ways to approach learning analytic data analysis and visualization.

abstract={This article addresses a relatively unexplored area in the emerging field of learning analytics, the design of learning analytics interventions. A learning analytics intervention is defined as the surrounding frame of activity through which analytic tools, data, and reports are taken up and used. It is a soft technology that involves the orchestration of the human process of engaging with the analytics as part of the larger teaching and learning activity. This paper first makes the case for the overall importance of intervention design, situating it within the larger landscape of the learning analytics field, and then considers the specific issues of intervention design for student use of learning analytics. Four principles of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design that can be used by teachers and course developers to support the productive use of learning analytics by students are introduced: Integration, Agency, Reference Frame and Dialogue. In addition three core processes in which to engage students are described: Grounding, Goal-Setting and Reflection. These principles and processes are united in a preliminary model of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design for students, presented as a starting point for further inquiry.

However, the forecasting literature has demonstrated the predictive equivalence of much simpler methods. We directly compare one simple tabulation technique, the index method, to a linear multiple regression approach for identifying students at risk. The broader purpose is to explore the plausibility of a flexible method that is conducive to adoption and diffusion. In this respect this paper fits within the ambit of the modest computing agenda, and suggests the possibility of a modest analytics. We built both regression and index method models on 2011 student data and applied these to 2012 student data. The index method was comparable in terms of predictive accuracy of student risk. We suggest that the context specificity of learning environments makes the index method a promising tool for educators who want a situated risk algorithm that is flexible and adaptable.

After distinguishing humane education from training on the basis of the Aristotelian model of intellectual capabilities, and arguing that humane education is distinct by virtue of its interest in cultivating prudence, which is unteachable, an account of three key characteristics of humane education is provided. Appealing to thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, it is argued that ingenium, eloquence, and self-knowledge constitute the what, how, and why of humane education. Lastly, looking to several examples from recent learning analytics literature, it is demonstrated that learning analytics is not only helpful as set of aids for ensuring success in scientific and technical disciplines, but in the humanities as well. In order to function effectively as an aid to humane education, however, learning analytics must be embedded within a context that encourages continuous reflection, responsiveness, and personal responsibility for learning.

However, the data that these systems generate is increasingly unstructured, complex, and therefore difficult of which to make sense of. Current computationally driven methods (e.g., latent semantic analysis or learning based image classifiers) for classifying student contributions don't include the ability to function on multi- modal artifacts (e.g., sketches, videos, or annotated images) that new technologies enable. We have developed and implemented a classification algorithm based on learners' interactions with the artifacts they create. This new form of semi-automated concept classification, coined Collaborative Spatial Classification, leverages the spatial arrangement of artifacts to provide a visualization that generates summary level data about about idea distribution. This approach has two benefits. First, students learn to identify and articulate patterns and connections among classmates ideas. Second, the teacher receives a high-level view of the distribution of ideas, enabling them to decide how to shift their instructional practices in real-time.

abstract={Early Warning Systems (EWSs) are being developed and used more frequently to aggregate multiple sources of data and provide timely information to stakeholders about students in need of academic support. As these systems grow more complex, there is an increasing need to incorporate relevant and real-time course-related information that could be predictors of a student's success or failure. This paper presents an investigation of how to incorporate students' use of course resources from a Learning Management System (LMS) into an existing EWS. Specifically, we focus our efforts on understanding the relationship between course resource use and a student's final course grade. Using ten semesters of LMS data from a requisite Chemistry course, we categorized course resources into four categories. We used a multinomial logistic regression model with semester fixed-effects to estimate the relationship between course resource use and the likelihood that a student receives an "A" or "B" in the course versus a "C." Results suggest that students who use Exam Preparation or Lecture resources to a greater degree than their peers are more likely to receive an "A" or "B" as a final grade. We discuss the implications of our results for the further development of this EWS and EWSs in general. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={Real-world learning in a field is an important educational area for experience-based activities. Formative assessment by constant monitoring of the intellectual achievement of real-world learners is essential for adaptive learning support, but no assessment methodology has yet been developed. We consider a method to systematically integrate heterogeneous factors of real-world learning: learners' internal situations, their external situations, and their learning field. Then, we propose a method for formatively assessing the situation of real-world learning. The method enables us to recognize the sequence of characteristic stay behavior and the associated body posture of a learner, and to estimate the 3D location of his/her interest. The method enables the estimation of not only the learning topic that a learner is currently examining in a field but also the prospective topics that he/she should learn. Our assessment method is the basis for context-aware support to promote the emergence of new knowledge from intellectual collaboration in the world.

abstract={Real-time formative assessment of student learning has become the subject of increasing attention. Students' textual responses to short answer questions offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, automatically analyzing textual constructed responses poses significant computational challenges, and the difficulty of generating accurate assessments is exacerbated by the disfluencies that occur prominently in elementary students' writing. With robust text analytics, there is the potential to accurately analyze students' text responses and predict students' future success. In this paper, we present WRITEEVAL, a hybrid text analytics method for analyzing student-composed text written in response to constructed response questions. Based on a model integrating a text similarity technique with a semantic analysis technique, WRITEEVAL performs well on responses written by fourth graders in response to short-text science questions. Further, it was found that WRITEEVAL's assessments correlate with summative analyses of student performance. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={Peer assessment is seen as a powerful supporting tool to achieve scalability in the evaluation of complex assignments in large courses, possibly virtual ones, as in the context of massive open online courses (MOOCs). However, the adoption of peer assessment is slow due in part to the lack of ready-to-use systems. Furthermore, the validity of peer assessment is still under discussion. In this paper, in order to tackle some of these issues, we present as a proof-of-concept of a novel extension of GRAASP, a social media platform, to setup a peer assessment activity. We then report a case study of peer assessment using GRAASP in a Social Media course with 60 master's level university students and analyze the level of agreement between students and instructors in the evaluation of short individual reports. Finally, to see if both instructor and student evaluations were based on appearance of project reports rather than on content, we conducted a study with 40 kids who rated reports solely on their look. Our results convey the fact that unlike the kid evaluation, which shows a low level of agreement with instructors, student assessment is reliable since the level of agreement between instructors and students was high.

abstract={This paper provides an evaluation of the current state of the field of learning analytics through analysis of articles and citations occurring in the LAK conferences and identified special issue journals. The emerging field of learning analytics is at the intersection of numerous academic disciplines, and therefore draws on a diversity of methodologies, theories and underpinning scientific assumptions. Through citation analysis and structured mapping we aimed to identify the emergence of trends and disciplinary hierarchies that are influencing the development of the field to date. The results suggest that there is some fragmentation in the major disciplines (computer science and education) regarding conference and journal representation. The analyses also indicate that the commonly cited papers are of a more conceptual nature than empirical research reflecting the need for authors to define the learning analytics space. An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides numerous benefits for the development of the field, such as a guide for under-represented areas of research and to identify the disciplines that may require more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities.

abstract={Learners often think math is unrelated to their own interests. Instructional software has the potential to provide personalized instruction that responds to individuals' interests. Carnegie Learning's MATHiaTM software for middle school mathematics asks learners to specify domains of their interest (e.g., sports & fitness, arts & music), as well as names of friends/classmates, and uses this information to both choose and personalize word problems for individual learners. Our analysis of MATHia's relatively coarse-grained personalization contrasts with more finegrained analysis in previous research on word problems in the Cognitive Tutor (e.g., finding effects on performance in parts of problems that depend on more difficult skills), and we explore associations of aggregate preference "honoring" with learner performance. To do so, we define a notion of "strong" learner interest area preferences and find that honoring such preferences has a small negative association with performance. However, learners that both merely express preferences (either interest area preferences or setting names of friends/classmates), and those that express strong preferences, tend to perform in ways that are associated with better learning compared to learners that do not express such preferences. We consider several explanations of these findings and suggest important topics for future research. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={Once learning analytics have been successfully developed and tested, the next step is to implement them at a larger scale - Across a faculty, an institution or an educational system. This introduces a new set of challenges, because education is a stable system, resistant to change. Implementing learning analytics at scale involves working with the entire technological complex that exists around technology-enhanced learning (TEL). This includes the different groups of people involved - learners, educators, administrators and support staff - the practices of those groups, their understandings of how teaching and learning take place, the technologies they use and the specific environments within which they operate. Each element of the TEL Complex requires explicit and careful consideration during the process of implementation, in order to avoid failure and maximise the chances of success. In order for learning analytics to be implemented successfully at scale, it is crucial to provide not only the analytics and their associated tools but also appropriate forms of support, training and community building.

abstract={Although video annotation software is no longer considered as a new innovation, its application in promoting student self-regulated learning and reflection skills has only begun to emerge in the research literature. Advances in text and video analytics provide the capability of investigating students' use of the tool and the psychometrics and linguistic processes evident in their written annotations. This paper reports on a study exploring students' use of a video annotation tool when two different instructional approaches were deployed - graded and non-graded self-reflection annotations within two courses in the performing arts. In addition to counts and temporal locations of self-reflections, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) framework was used for the extraction of variables indicative of the linguistic and psychological processes associated with self-reflection annotations of videos. The results indicate that students in the course with graded self reflections adopted more linguistic and psychological related processes in comparison to the course with non-graded self reflections. In general, the effect size of the graded reflections was lower for students who took both courses in parallel. Consistent with prior research, the study identified that students tend to make the majority of their self-reflection annotations early in the video time line. The paper also provides several suggestions for future research to better understand the application of video annotations in facilitating student learning.

abstract={This paper reports findings from the implementation of a learning analytics-powered Early Warning System (EWS) by academic advisors who were novice users of data-driven learning analytics tools. The information collected from these users sheds new light on how student analytic data might be incorporated into the work practices of advisors working with university students. Our results indicate that advisors predominantly used the EWS during their meetings with students-despite it being designed as a tool to provide information to prepare for meetings and identify students who are struggling academically. This introduction of an unintended audience brings significant design implications to bear that are relevant for learning analytics innovations.

abstract={In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for organizing emerging analytic activities involving educational data that can fall under broad and often loosely defined categories, including Academic/Institutional Analytics, Learning Analytics/ Educational Data Mining, Learner Analytics/Personalization, and Systemic Instructional Improvement. While our approach is substantially informed by both higher education and K-12 settings, this framework is developed to apply across all educational contexts where digital data are used to inform learners and the management of learning. Although we can identify movements that are relatively independent of each other today, we believe they will in all cases expand from their current margins to encompass larger domains and increasingly overlap. The growth in these analytic activities leads to the need to find ways to synthesize understandings, find common language, and develop frames of reference to help these movements develop into a field.

We have used data from 84 undergraduate students who followed an online course using Moodle 2.0. We propose to group students firstly starting from data about Moodle's usage summary and/or the students' final marks in the course. Then, we propose to use data from Moodle's logs about each cluster/group of students separately in order to be able to obtain more specific and accurate models of students' behaviour. The results show that the fitness of the specific models is greater than the general model obtained using all the data, and the comprehensibility of the models can be also improved in some cases.

abstract={Closing the feedback loop to improve learning is at the heart of good learning analytics practice. However, the quantity of data, and the range of different data sources, can make it difficult to take systematic action on that data. Previous work in the literature has emphasised the need for and value of human meaning-making in the process of interpretation of data to transform it in to actionable intelligence. This paper describes a programme of human Data Wranglers deployed at the Open University, UK, charged with making sense of a range of data sources related to learning, analysing that data in the light of their understanding of practice in individual faculties/departments, and producing reports that summarise the key points and make actionable recommendations. The evaluation of and experience in this programme of work strongly supports the value of human meaning-makers in the learning analytics process, and suggests that barriers to organisational change in this area can be mitigated by embedding learning analytics work within strategic contexts, and working at an appropriate level and granularity of analysis.

The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course selections for all engineering students based on their incoming characteristics and previous course history and performance, paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. We found that ACT Math, SAT Math, and Advanced Placement exam can be effective measures to measure the students' academic preparation level. Also, we found that some concurrent courseenrollment patterns are highly predictive of first-term and overall academic success. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

In particular, we highlight a set of qualitative interviews that we conducted with individual students after a short study in which students in three classes at the same school learned to use virtual manipulatives to compare pairs of proper fractions and order groups of 3 proper fractions. These qualitative interviews provided us with considerable information that helped us improve the interactions students have with the virtual manipulatives and produce more sophisticated and informative analytics. We emphasize the importance of using mixed-methods during the iterative cycles of development that define design research. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of resource access patterns in a recently conducted master level university course. The specialty of the course was that it followed a new teaching approach by providing additional learning resources such as wikis, self-tests and videos. To gain deeper insights into the usage of the provided learning material we have built dynamic bipartite student - resource networks based on event logs of resource access. These networks are analysed using methods adapted from social network analysis. In particular we uncover bipartite clusters of students and resources in those networks and propose a method to identify patterns and traces of their evolution over time.

abstract={While the landscape of learning analytics is relatively well defined, the extent to which institutions are ready to embark on an analytics implementation is less known. Further, while work has been done on measuring the maturity of an institution's implementation, this work fails to investigate how an institution that has not implemented analytics to date might become mature over time. To that end, the authors developed and piloted a survey, the Learning Analytics Readiness Instrument (LARI), in an attempt to help institutions successfully prepare themselves for a successfully analytics implementation. The LARI is comprised of 90 items encompassing five factors related to a learning analytics implementation: (1) Ability, (2) Data, (3) Culture and Process, (4) Governance and Infrastructure, and, (5) Overall Readiness Perception. Each of the five factors has a high internal consistency, as does the overall tool. This paper discusses the need for a survey such as the LARI, the tool's psychometric properties, the authors' broad interpretations of the findings, and next steps for the LARI and the research in this field.

abstract={The aim of this study is to suggest more meaningful components for learning analytics in order to help learners improving their learning achievement continuously through an educational technology approach. Multiple linear regression analysis is conducted to determine which factors influence student's academic achievement. 84 undergraduate students in a women's university in South Korea participated in this study. The sixpredictor model was able to account for 33.5% of the variance in final grade, F(6, 77) = 6.457, p < .001, R2 = .335. Total studying time in LMS, interaction with peers, regularity of learning interval in LMS, and number of downloads were determined to be significant factors for students' academic achievement in online learning environment. These four controllable variables not only predict learning outcomes significantly but also can be changed if learners put more effort to improve their academic performance. The results provide a rationale for the treatment for student time management effort. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

Using a rich knowledge building discourse dataset, in which notes' contribution types and threads' productivity have been coded, a secondary temporal analysis was conducted. In particular, Lag-sequential Analysis was conducted to identify transitional patterns among different contribution types that distinguish productive threads from\improvable" ones. Results indicated that productive inquiry threads involved significantly more transitions among questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information; in contrast, responding to questions and theories by merely giving opinions was not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress. This study highlights the importance of investigating temporality in collaborative learning and calls for attention to developing and testing temporal analysis methods in learning analytics research.

This approach, though, may fail to find cases where model performance suffers if other aspects of those cases relevant to prediction are not well represented. We explore this here by testing if scientific inquiry skill models built and validated for one science topic can predict skill demonstration for new students and a new science topic. Test cases were chosen using two methods: student-level stratification, and stratification based on the amount of trials ran during students' experimentation. We found that predictive performance of the models was different on each test set, revealing limitations that would have been missed from student-level validation alone. © 2013 ACM.},

We focus our studies on the initial hypothesis that 3D immersive environments are highly engaging and offer an experience that goes beyond the 'traditional' online education. We want to combine different analysis methods to be able to get empirical evidence showing the students' engagement with the 3D space in ways that can help us in the design of the learning experience accompanying the learners in their journey. In this paper we describe the research methods we use for the study, and give an overview of the information we can collect from the in-world analytics.

We examine, which questions are not yet supported and propose concepts of indicators that have a high potential of positively influencing teachers' didactical considerations. Our investigation shows that many questions of teachers cannot be answered with currently available research tools. Furthermore, few learning analytics studies report about measuring impact.

abstract={Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are growing substantially in numbers, and also in interest from the educational community. MOOCs offer particular challenges for what is becoming accepted as mainstream practice in learning analytics. Partly for this reason, and partly because of the relative newness of MOOCs as a widespread phenomenon, there is not yet a substantial body of literature on the learning analytics of MOOCs. However, one clear finding is that drop-out/non-completion rates are substantially higher than in more traditional education. This paper explores these issues, and introduces the metaphor of a 'funnel of participation' to reconceptualise the steep drop-off in activity, and the pattern of steeply unequal participation, which appear to be characteristic of MOOCs and similar learning environments. Empirical data to support this funnel of participation are presented from three online learning sites: iSpot (observations of nature), Cloudworks ('a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences'), and openED 2.0, a MOOC on business and management that ran between 2010 - 2012. Implications of the funnel for MOOCs, formal education, and learning analytics practice are discussed. © 2013 ACM.},

In this paper, we look at a specific data mining method, namely sequential pattern extraction, and we demonstrate an approach that exploits available linked open data for this interpretation task. Indeed, we show through a case study relying on data about students' enrolment in course modules how linked data can be used to provide a variety of additional dimensions through which the results of the data mining method can be explored, providing, at interpretation time, new input into the analytics process. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={One of the key interests for learning analytics is how it can be used to improve retention. This paper focuses on work conducted at the Open University (OU) into predicting students who are at risk of failing their module. The Open University is one of the worlds largest distance learning institutions. Since tutors do not interact face to face with students, it can be difficult for tutors to identify and respond to students who are struggling in time to try to resolve the difficulty. Predictive models have been developed and tested using historic Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) activity data combined with other data sources, for three OU modules. This has revealed that it is possible to predict student failure by looking for changes in user's activity in the VLE, when compared against their own previous behaviour, or that of students who can be categorised as having similar learning behaviour. More focused analysis of these modules applying the GUHA (General Unary Hypothesis Automaton) method of data analysis has also yielded some early promising results for creating accurate hypothesis about students who fail. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={To process low level educational data in the form of user events and interactions and convert them into information about the learning process that is both meaningful and interesting presents a challenge. In this paper, we propose a set of high level learning parameters relating to total use, efficient use, activity time distribution, gamification habits, or exercise-making habits, and provide the measures to calculate them as a result of processing low level data. We apply these parameters and measures in a real physics course with more than 100 students using the Khan Academy platform at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. We show how these parameters can be meaningful and useful for the learning process based on the results from this experience. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Social Learning Analytics (SLA) are designed to support students learning through social networks, and reflective practitioners engage in informal learning through a community of practice. This short paper reports work in progress to develop SLA motivated specifically by Networked Learning Theory, drawing on the related concepts and tools of Social Network Analytics and Social Capital Theory, which provide complementary perspectives onto the structure and content of such networks. We propose that SLA based on these perspectives needs to devise models and visualizations capable of showing not only the usual SNA metrics, but the types of social tie forged between actors, and topic-specific subnetworks. We describe a technical implementation demonstrating this approach, which extends the Network Awareness Tool by automatically populating it with data from a social learning platform SocialLearn. The result is the ability to visualize relationships between people who interact around the same topics. © 2013 ACM.},

It is expected that being able to put together different datasets from various applications will make it possible to support learning analytics of a much larger scale and across different contexts. We examine how this can be achieved from a practical perspective by carrying out a study that focuses on three real datasets. More specifically, we combine social data that has been collected from the users of three learning portals and reflect on how they should be handled. We start by studying the data types and formats that these portals use to represent and store social and usage data. Then we develop crosswalks between the different schemas, so that merged versions of the source datasets may be created. The results of this bottom-up, hands-on investigation reveal several interesting issues that need to be overcome before aggregated sets of social and usage data can be actually used to support learning analytics research or services. © 2013 ACM.},

Learning science must connect with learning pedagogy and design. Learners and institutions must have access to tools and resources that assist in customizing student progress and supplemental learning needs. Teachers and faculty must be empowered to provide teaching and learning environments that allow individual students to thrive. All this will require unique partnerships and collaborations within and across institutions, incorporating the best learning science findings and bridging with public and private entities developing the learning and analytic tools to support personalized learning.

abstract={This workshop anticipates that an important class of learning analytic will emerge at the intersection of research into learning dynamics, online discussion platforms, and computational linguistics. Written discourse is arguably the primary class of data that can give us insights into deeper learning and higher order qualities such as critical thinking, argumentation, mastery of complex ideas, empathy, collaboration and interpersonal skills. Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that discourse. This workshop aims to catalyse ideas and build community connections among those who want to shape this field. © 2013 Authors.},

Learning Analytics (LA) is a new assessment technology and should engage with this literature since it has implications for when and why different LA tools might be deployed. This paper discusses these issues, relating them to an example construct, epistemic beliefs - beliefs about the nature of knowledge - for which analytics grounded in pragmatic, sociocultural theory might be well placed to explore. This example is particularly interesting given the role of epistemic beliefs in the everyday knowledge judgements students make in their information processing. Traditional psychological approaches to measuring epistemic beliefs have parallels with high stakes testing regimes; this paper outlines an alternative LA for epistemic beliefs which might be readily applied to other areas of interest. Such sociocultural approaches afford opportunity for engaging LA directly in high quality pedagogy. © 2013 ACM.},

In the treatment group, they could see the gaze of their partner displayed on the screen in real-time. In the control group, they could not. Dyads in the treatment group achieved a higher quality of collaboration and a higher learning gain. In this paper, we describe how network analysis techniques can further illuminate these results, and contribute to the development of 'collaboration sensing'. More specifically, we describe two contributions: first, one can use networks to visualize and explore eye-tracking data. Second, network metrics can be computed to interpret the properties of the graph. We conclude with comments on implementing this approach for formal learning environments. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={As MOOCs grow in popularity, the relatively low completion rates of learners has been a central criticism. This focus on completion rates, however, reflects a monolithic view of disengagement that does not allow MOOC designers to target interventions or develop adaptive course features for particular subpopulations of learners. To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies a small number of longitudinal engagement trajectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date. In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assessments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across demographics, forum participation, video access, and reports of overall experience. These results inform a discussion of future interventions, research, and design directions for MOOCs. Potential improvements to the classification mechanism are also discussed, including the introduction of more fine-grained analytics. © 2013 ACM.},

A pedagogical model that translates the concepts and findings of the research program into guidelines for practice and analytics with which students and instructors can assess their discussion participation are presented. The analytics are both embedded in the learning environment and extracted from it, allowing for integrated and reflective metacognitive activity. The pedagogical intervention is based on the principles of (1) Integration (2) Diversity (of Metrics) (3) Agency (4) Reflection (5) Parity and (6) Dialogue. Details of an initial implementation of this approach and preliminary findings are described. Initial results strongly support the value of student-teacher dialogue around the analytics. In contrast, instructor parity in analytics use did not seem as important to students as was expected. Analytics were reported as useful in validating invisible discussion activity, but at times triggered emotionally-charged responses. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={A large number of curated digital collections containing learning resources of a various kind has emerged in the last year. These include referatories containing descriptions for resources in the Web (as MERLOT), aggregated collections (as Organic.Edunet), concrete initiatives as Khan Academy, repositories hosting and versioning modular content (as Connexions) and meta-aggregators (as Globe and Learning Registry). Also, OpenCourseware and other OER initiatives have contributed to making this ecosystem of resources richer. Very interesting insights can be extracted when studying the usage and social data that are produced within the learning collections, repositories and federations. At the same time, concerns for the quality and sustainability of these collections have been raised, which has lead to research on quality measurement and metrics. The Workshop attempts to bring studies and demonstrations for any kind of analysis done on learning resource collections, from an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider digital collections not as merely IT deployments but as social systems with contributors, owners, evaluators and users forming patterns of interactions on top of portals or through search systems embedded in other learning technology components. This is in coherence of considering these social systems under a Web Science approach (http://webscience.org/). © 2013 Authors.},

abstract={This paper reports on our research on the use of learning analytics dashboards to support awareness, self-reflection, sensemaking and impact for learners. So far, little research has been done to evaluate such dashboards with students and to assess their impact on learning. In this paper, we present the results of an evaluation study of our dashboard, called StepUp!, and the extent to which it addresses issues and needs of our students. Through brainstorming sessions with our students, we identified and prioritized learning issues and needs. In a second step, we deployed StepUp! during one month and we evaluated to which extent our dashboard addresses the issues and needs identified earlier in different courses. The results show that our tool has potentially higher impact for students working in groups and sharing a topic than students working individually on different topics. © 2013 ACM.},

Using this approach we uncover new ideas about how experts engage in building activities.

abstract={Social media platforms such as Facebook are now a ubiquitous part of everyday life for many people. New media scholars posit that the participatory culture encouraged by social media gives rise to new forms of literacy skills that are vital to learning. However, there have been few attempts to use analytics to understand the new media literacy skills that may be embedded in an individual's participation in social media. In this paper, I collect raw activity data that was shared by an exploratory sample of Facebook users. I then utilize factor analysis and regression models to show how (a) Facebook members' online activity coalesce into distinct categories of social media behavior and (b) how these participatory behaviors correlate with and predict measures of new media literacy skills. The study demonstrates the use of analytics to understand the literacies embedded in people's social media activity. The implications speak to the potential of social learning analytics to identify and predict new media literacy skills from data streams in social media platforms. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The "gamification" of courses (i.e., designing courses that leverage motivational mechanisms found in videogames) is a movement that is gaining traction in educational research communities and universities. Two game-inspired courses were developed at a high-enrollment public university in an effort to increase student engagement, and to provide students with more personalized learning experiences. We designed a learning management system, GradeCraft, to foreground the affordances of these grading systems, and to enhance the "game-like" experience for students. Along with serving as a translation layer for the grading systems of these courses, GradeCraft is also designed with an eye towards learning analytics, and captures information that can be described as student "process" data. Currently this data includes what types of assignments students choose to complete; how students assign percentage weights to their chosen assignments; how often and how accurately students check or model their course grades; and how successfully assignments are completed by students individually and the class as a whole across a structured grading rubric. We hope GradeCraft will give instructors new insight into student engagement, and provide data-driven ideas about how to tailor courses to student needs. © 2013 ACM.},

Dialogue in this middle space involves diverse stakeholders from multiple disciplines with various conceptions of the agency and nature of learning. We hold that a singularly unified field is not possible nor even desirable if we are to leverage the potential of this diversity, but progress is possible if we support "productive multivocality" between the diverse voices involved, facilitated by appropriate use of boundary objects. We summarize the submitted papers and contents of these Proceedings to characterize the voices and topics involved in the multivocal discourse of Learning Analytics. © 2013 Authors.},

abstract={The use of cloud computing writing tools, such as Google Docs, by students to write collaboratively provides unprecedented data about the progress of writing. This data can be exploited to gain insights on how learners' collaborative activities, ideas and concepts are developed during the process of writing. Ultimately, it can also be used to provide support to improve the quality of the written documents and the writing skills of learners involved. In this paper, we propose three visualisation approaches and their underlying techniques for analysing writing processes used in a document written by a group of authors: (1) the revision map, which summarises the text edits made at the paragraph level, over the time of writing. (2) the topic evolution chart, which uses probabilistic topic models, especially Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its extension, DiffLDA, to extract topics and follow their evolution during the writing process. (3) the topic-based collaboration network, which allows a deeper analysis of topics in relation to author contribution and collaboration, using our novel algorithm DiffATM in conjunction with a DiffLDA-related technique. These models are evaluated to examine whether these automatically discovered topics accurately describe the evolution of writing processes. We illustrate how these visualisations are used with real documents written by groups of graduate students. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Social learning analytics are concerned with the process of knowledge construction as learners build knowledge together in their social and cultural environments. One of the most important tools employed during this process is language. In this paper we take exploratory dialogue, a joint form of co-reasoning, to be an external indicator that learning is taking place. Using techniques developed within the field of computational linguistics, we build on previous work using cue phrases to identify exploratory dialogue within online discussion. Automatic detection of this type of dialogue is framed as a binary classification task that labels each contribution to an online discussion as exploratory or non-exploratory. We describe the development of a self-training framework that employs discourse features and topical features for classification by integrating both cue-phrase matching and k-nearest neighbour classification. Experiments with a corpus constructed from the archive of a two-day online conference show that our proposed framework outperforms other approaches. A classifier developed using the self-training framework is able to make useful distinctions between the learning dialogue taking place at different times within an online conference as well as between the contributions of individual participants. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Open-ended learning environments (OELEs) provide students with opportunities to take part in authentic and complex problem-solving tasks. However, many students struggle to succeed in such complex learning endeavors. Without support, these students often use system tools incorrectly and adopt suboptimal learning strategies. However, providing adaptive support to students in OELEs poses significant challenges, and relatively few OELEs provide students with adaptive support. This paper presents the initial development of a systematic approach for interpreting and evaluating learner behaviors in OELEs called model-driven assessments, which uses a model of the cognitive and metacognitive processes important for completing the open-ended learning task. The model provides a means for both classifying and assessing students' learning behaviors while using the system. An evaluation of the analysis technique is presented in the context of Betty's Brain, an OELE designed to help middle school students learn about science. © 2013 ACM.},

The main objective of WAVe is to build a research community around the topical area of Analytics on video-based learning. In particular, WAVe aims to develop a critical discussion about the next generation of analytics employed on video learning tools, the form of these analytics and the way they can be analyzed in order to help us to better understand and improve the value of video-based learning. WAVe is based on the rationale that combining and analyzing learners' interactions with other available data obtained from learners, new avenues for research on video-based learning have emerged. © 2013 Authors.},

Through the definition of directed acyclic graphs the meaningful interconnectedness of learning resources is made accessible to analysis in consideration of the temporal sequence of their creation during a collaborative process. The potential of the method is elaborated for analyzing the overall learning process of a community as well as the individual contributions of the participants. © 2013 ACM.},

Reliable feedback from the audience could improve personal skills and work performance. To address this shortcoming we have developed the Live Interest Meter App (LIM App) that supports the gathering, aggregation and visualization of feedback. This application allows audience members to easily provide and quantify their feedback through a simple meter. We conducted several experimental tests to investigate the acceptance and perceived usefulness of the LIM App and a user study in an academic setting to inform its further development. The results of the study illustriate the potential of the LIM App to be used in such scenarios. Main findings show the need for motivating students to use the application, the readiness of presenters to learn retrospectively, and distraction as the main concern of end users. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Higher education institutions have collected and analysed student data for years, with their focus largely on reporting and management needs. A range of institutional policies exist which broadly set out the purposes for which data will be used and how data will be protected. The growing advent of learning analytics has seen the uses to which student data is put expanding rapidly. Generally though the policies setting out institutional use of student data have not kept pace with this change. Institutional policy frameworks should provide not only an enabling environment for the optimal and ethical harvesting and use of data, but also clarify: who benefits and under what conditions, establish conditions for consent and the de-identification of data, and address issues of vulnerability and harm. A directed content analysis of the policy frameworks of two large distance education institutions shows that current policy frameworks do not facilitate the provision of an enabling environment for learning analytics to fulfil its promise. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the correspondence between student affect in a web-based tutoring platform throughout the school year and learning outcomes at the end of the year, on a high-stakes mathematics exam. The relationships between affect and learning outcomes have been previously studied, but not in a manner that is both longitudinal and finer-grained. Affect detectors are used to estimate student affective states based on post-hoc analysis of tutor log-data. For every student action in the tutor the detectors give us an estimated probability that the student is in a state of boredom, engaged concentration, confusion, and frustration, and estimates of the probability that they are exhibiting off-task or gaming behaviors. We ran the detectors on two years of log-data from 8th grade student use of the ASSISTments math tutoring system and collected corresponding end of year, high stakes, state math test scores for the 1,393 students in our cohort. By correlating these data sources, we find that boredom during problem solving is negatively correlated with performance, as expected; however, boredom is positively correlated with performance when exhibited during scaffolded tutoring. A similar pattern is unexpectedly seen for confusion. Engaged concentration and frustration are both associated with positive learning outcomes, surprisingly in the case of frustration. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Despite all the research on student retention and success since the first conceptual mappings of student success e.g. Spady [12], there have not been equal impacts on the rates of both student success and retention. To realise the potential of learning analytics to impact on student retention and success, mega open distance learning (ODL) institutions face a number of challenges, paradoxes and opportunities. For the purpose of this paper we critique a 'closed' view of learning analytics as focusing only on data produced by students' interactions with institutions of higher learning. Students are not the only actors in their learning journeys and it would seem crucial that learning analytics also includes the impacts of all stakeholders on students' learning journeys in order to increase the success of students' learning. As such the notion of 'Thirdspace' as used by cultural, postmodern and identity theorists provide a useful heuristic to map the challenges and opportunities, but also the paradoxes of learning analytics and its potential impact on student success and retention. This paper explores some of these challenges, paradoxes and opportunities with reference to two mega ODL institutions namely the Open University in the UK (OU) and the University of South Africa (Unisa). Although these two institutions share a number of characteristics, there are also some major and important differences between them. We explore some of the shared challenges, paradoxes and opportunities learning analytics offer in the context of these two institutions. © 2012 ACM.},

Reflective learning means returning to and evaluating past experiences in order to promote continuous learning and improve future experiences. Whilst the reflective learning theories do not sufficiently consider technical support, Quantified Self (QS) approaches are rather experimental and the many emergent tools are disconnected from the goals and benefits of their use. This paper brings these two strands into one unified framework that shows how QS approaches can support reflective learning processes on the one hand and how reflective learning can inform the design of new QS tools for informal learning purposes on the other hand. © 2012 ACM.},

We also show that the estimated start competence corresponds well to our expectations based on the previous experience of the students in the logic domain.

abstract={This paper describes a new method for the objective evaluation of student work through the identification of original content in writing assignments. Using WordNet as a lexical reference, this process allows instructors to track how key phrases are employed and evolve over the course of a student's writing, and to automatically visualize the point at which the student's language first demonstrates original thought, phrased in their own, original words. The paper presents a case study where the analysis method was evaluated by analyzing co-blogging data from a reading and writing intensive undergraduate course. The evidence shows that the tool can be predictive of students' writing in a manner that correlates with their progress in the course and engagement in the technology-mediated activity. By visualizing otherwise subjective information in a way that is objectively intelligible, the goal is to provide educators with the ability to monitor student investment in concepts from the course syllabus, and to extend or modify the boundaries of the syllabus in anticipation of pre-existing knowledge or trends in interest. A tool of this sort can be of value particularly in larger gateway courses, where the sheer size of the class makes the ongoing evaluation of student progress a daunting if not otherwise impossible task. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a new, analytics driven approach to supporting students in large introductory physics courses. For this project, we have assembled data for more than 49,000 physics students at the University of Michigan. For each, we combine an extensive portrait of background and preparation with details of progress through the course and final outcome. This information allows us to construct models predicting student performance with a dispersion of half a letter grade. We explore residuals to this model, conducting structured interviews with students who did better (and worse) than expected, identifying strategies which lead to student success (and failure) at all levels of preparation. This work was done in preparation for the launch of E 2Coach: a computer tailored educational coaching project which provides a model for an intervention engine, capable of dealing with actionable information for thousands of students. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Traditional models of learning using a sociological perspective include social learning, situated learning and models of connectivisim and self-efficacy. While these models explain how individuals learn in varying social dimensions, very few studies provide empirical validation of such models and extend them to include group learning and performance. In this exploratory study, we develop a theoretical model based on social learning and social network theories to understand how knowledge professionals engage in learning and performance, both as individuals and as groups. We investigate the association between egocentric network properties (structure, position and tie), 'content richness' in the social learning process and performance. Analysis from data collected using an online eLearning environment shows that rather than performance; social learning is influenced by properties of social network structure (density, inter-group and intra-network communication), relations (tie strength) and position (efficiency). Furthermore, individuals who communicate with others internal rather than external to the group show higher tendencies of social learning. The contribution of this study is therefore two-fold: a theoretical development of a social learning and networks based model for understanding learning and performance; and the construction of a novel metric called 'content richness' as a surrogate measure for social learning. In conclusion, a useful implication of the study is that the model fosters understanding social factors that influence learning and performance in the domain of learning analytics. It also begs the question of whether the relationship between social networks and performance is mediated or moderated by learning and whether assumptions of the model hold true in non-educational domains. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Digital environments for networked learning and professional networks may not comprise one "community:" identification of clusters of affiliated groups of participants that potentially constitute embedded communities is an empirical matter, and one of interest to managers of large learning and professional networks. Also, these socio-technical networks are typically multi-mediated, in that they offer multiple means of participation, each with their own interactional affordances. Different communities may be using the multiple media in different ways. We have developed an analytic framework for extracting events from log files and representing interaction and affiliations at different granularities as needed for analysis. In this paper we show how bimodal networks of actors and media artifacts can be constructed in which directed arcs relate actors to the artifacts they read, write or edit, and how the resulting graphs can be used to detect community structures that extend across different media. We illustrate these ideas with a study that characterizes community structure within the Tapped In network of educational professionals, and how the associations between members of this network are distributed across media (chat rooms, discussion forums and file sharing). © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={One of the first and basic mathematical knowledge of school children is the multiplication table. At the age of 8 to 10 each child has to learn by training step by step, or more scientifically, by using a behavioristic learning concept. Due to this fact it can be mentioned that we know very well about the pedagogical approach, but on the other side there is rather less knowledge about the increase of step-by-step knowledge of the school children. In this publication we present some data documenting the fluctuation in the process of acquiring the multiplication tables. We report the development of an algorithm which is able to adapt the given tasks out of a given pool to unknown pupils. For this purpose a web-based application for learning the multiplication table was developed and then tested by children. Afterwards so-called learning curves of each child were drawn and analyzed by the research team as well as teachers carrying out interesting outcomes. Learning itself is maybe not as predictable as we know from pedagogical experiences, it is a very individualized process of the learners themselves. It can be summarized that the algorithm itself as well as the learning curves are very useful for studying the learning success. Therefore it can be concluded that learning analytics will become an important step for teachers and learners of tomorrow. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Theoretical and empirical evidence in the learning sciences substantiates the view that deep engagement in learning is a function of a complex combination of learners' identities, dispositions, values, attitudes and skills. When these are fragile, learners struggle to achieve their potential in conventional assessments, and critically, are not prepared for the novelty and complexity of the challenges they will meet in the workplace, and the many other spheres of life which require personal qualities such as resilience, critical thinking and collaboration skills. To date, the learning analytics research and development communities have not addressed how these complex concepts can be modelled and analysed, and how more traditional social science data analysis can support and be enhanced by learning analytics. We report progress in the design and implementation of learning analytics based on a research validated multidimensional construct termed "learning power". We describe, for the first time, a learning analytics infrastructure for gathering data at scale, managing stakeholder permissions, the range of analytics that it supports from real time summaries to exploratory research, and a particular visual analytic which has been shown to have demonstrable impact on learners. We conclude by summarising the ongoing research and development programme and identifying the challenges of integrating traditional social science research, with learning analytics and modelling. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Commons-based Peer Production is the process by which internet communities create media and software artefacts. Learning is integral to the success of these communities as it encourages contribution on an individual level, helps to build and sustain commitment on a group level and provides a means for adaption at an organisational level. While some communities have established ways to support organisational learning - through a forum or thread reserved for community discussion - few have investigated how more in-depth visual and analytic interfaces could help formalise this process. In this paper, we explore how social network visualisation can be used to encourage reflection and thus support organisational learning in online communities. We make the following contributions: First, we describe Commons-Based Peer Production, in terms of a socio-technical learning system that includes individual, group and organisational learning. Second, we present a novel visualisation environment that embeds social network visualisation in an asynchronous collaborative architecture. Third, we present results from an evaluation and discuss the potential for visualisation to support the process of organisational reflection in online communities. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Due to the idiosyncrasy of online education, students may become disoriented, frustrated or confused if they do not receive the support, feedback or guidance needed to be successful. To avoid this, the role of teachers is essential. In this regard, instructors should be facilitators who guide students throughout the teaching-learning process and arrange meaningful learner-centered experiences. However, unlike face-to-face classes, teachers have difficulty in monitoring their learners in an online environment, since a lot of learning management systems provide faculty with student tracking data in a poor tabular format that is difficult to understand. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a novel graphical educational monitoring tool based on faceted browsing that helps instructors to gain an insight into their classrooms' performance. Moreover, this tool depicts information of each individual student by using a data portrait. Thanks to this monitoring tool, teachers can, on the one hand, track their students during the teaching-learning process and, on the other, detect potential problems in time. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={We propose a novel design of a Student Success System (S3), a holistic analytical system for identifying and treating at-risk students. S3 synthesizes several strands of risk analytics: the use of predictive models to identify academically at-risk students, the creation of data visualizations for reaching diagnostic insights, and the application of a case-based approach for managing interventions. Such a system poses numerous design, implementation, and research challenges. In this paper we discuss a core research challenge for designing early warning systems such as S3. We then propose our approach for meeting that challenge. A practical implementation of an student risk early warning system, utilizing predictive models, must meet two design criteria: a) the methodology for generating predictive models must be flexible to allow generalization from one context to another; b) the underlying mechanism of prediction should be easily interpretable by practitioners whose end goal is to design meaningful interventions on behalf of students. Our proposed solution applies an ensemble method for predictive modeling using a strategy of decomposition. Decomposition provides a flexible technique for generating and generalizing predictive models across different contexts. Decomposition into interpretable semantic units, when coupled with data visualizations and case management tools, allows practitioners, such as instructors and advisors, to build a bridge between prediction and intervention. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={While there is currently much buzz about the new field of learning analytics [19] and the potential it holds for benefiting teaching and learning, the impression one currently gets is that there is also much uncertainty and hesitation, even extending to scepticism. A clear common understanding and vision for the domain has not yet formed among the educator and research community. To investigate this situation, we distributed a stakeholder survey in September 2011 to an international audience from different sectors of education. The findings provide some further insights into the current level of understanding and expectations toward learning analytics among stakeholders. The survey was scaffolded by a conceptual framework on learning analytics that was developed based on a recent literature review. It divides the domain of learning analytics into six critical dimensions. The preliminary survey among 156 educational practitioners and researchers mostly from the higher education sector reveals substantial uncertainties in learning analytics. In this article, we first briefly introduce the learning analytics framework and its six domains that formed the backbone structure to our survey. Afterwards, we describe the method and key results of the learning analytics questionnaire and draw further conclusions for the field in research and practice. The article finishes with plans for future research on the questionnaire and the publication of both data and the questions for others to utilize. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of informal workplace learning in contemporary face-to-face and virtual environments. Informal learning is an important driver for professional development and workplace learning. However powerful informal learning may be, there is a problem when it comes to making it a real asset within organizations: Informal learning activities are mostly invisible to others, sometimes the learners themselves might not even be aware of the learning that occurs. As a consequence informal learning in organizations goes undetected, remains off the radar of HR departments and is therefore hard to asses, manage and value [1]. This problem poses an interesting challenge for the field of Learning Analytics, namely finding ways to capture and analyse traces of (social) informal learning in every day life and work networks. Therefore empirical research and tools are needed that can raise awareness about informal learning activities to make it surface the radar, amplify the benefits of it and strengthen the social relations through which it occurs. In this paper we introduce a tool that aims to facilitate exactly this and we hope to stimulate to widen the discussion on Learning Analytics by expanding the field from a predominantly educational focus to informal and workplace learning. In this paper we will discuss methodologies that Learning Analytics can draw upon to make informal learning more explicit and accessible to analyse and to share amongst professionals. © 2012 ACM.},

Each cluster of users is considered as a subset of the community of learners sharing a similar domain of interest. Accordingly, a recommender system is proposed to predict and recommend learning resources to cyberlearners within the same community. Experiments on real, dynamic data reveal the structure of community in the network. Our approach used the optimal discovered structure based on the modularity value to design a recommender system. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Simulated environments for learning are becoming increasingly popular to support experiential learning in complex domains. A key challenge when designing simulated learning environments is how to align the experience in the simulated world with real world experiences. Social media resources provide user-generated content that is rich in digital traces of real world experiences. People comments, tweets, and blog posts in social spaces can reveal interesting aspects of real world situations or can show what particular group of users is interested in or aware of. This paper examines a systematic way to analyze user-generated content in social media resources to provide useful information for learning simulator design. A hybrid framework exploiting Machine Learning and Semantics for social group profiling is presented. The framework has five stages: (1) Retrieval of user-generated content from the social resource (2) Content noise filtration, removing spam, abuse, and content irrelevant to the learning domain; (3) Deriving individual social profiles for the content authors; (4) Clustering of individuals into groups of similar authors; and (5) Deriving group profiles, where interesting concepts suitable for the use in simulated learning systems are extracted from the aggregated content authored by each group. The framework is applied to derive group profiles by mining user comments on YouTube videos. The application is evaluated in an experimental study within the context of learning interpersonal skills in job interviews. The paper discusses how the YouTube-based group profiles can be used to facilitate the design of a job interview skills learning simulator, considering: (1) identifying learning needs based on digital traces of real world experiences; and (2) augmenting learner models in simulators based on group characteristics derived from social media. © 2012 ACM.},

While analyzing usage data with teachers, we have noticed that the number of students attempting non self-tests decreases during the semester. Teachers were interested in investigating this pattern further to uncover the strategy adopted by students. In this paper, we explain our approach to investigate the core group effect in resources usage: given a set of resources, is a group of students emerging that continuously uses the resources or, on the contrary, are the resources used on an irregular basis by different students? We answer this question checking the confidence of what we call local rules and global rules.

The data collected is based off of students' interactions with Cognitive Tutor learning software. Analysis suggested that more complex functions did not fit the data significantly better than a linear function. In addition, there was not evidence that the length of a specific pause matters for predicting learning outcomes; e.g. students who make many short pauses do not appear to learn more or less than students who make a smaller number of long pauses. As such, previous theoretical accounts arguing that off-task behavior primarily reduces learning by reducing the amount of time spent learning remain congruent with the current evidence. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This paper develops Campbell and Oblinger's [4] five-step model of learning analytics (Capture, Report, Predict, Act, Refine) and other theorisations of the field, and draws on broader educational theory (including Kolb and Schön) to articulate an incrementally more developed, explicit and theoretically-grounded Learning Analytics Cycle. This cycle conceptualises successful learning analytics work as four linked steps: learners (1) generating data (2) that is used to produce metrics, analytics or visualisations (3). The key step is 'closing the loop' by feeding back this product to learners through one or more interventions (4). This paper seeks to begin to place learning analytics practice on a base of established learning theory, and draws several implications from this theory for the improvement of learning analytics projects. These include speeding up or shortening the cycle so feedback happens more quickly, and widening the audience for feedback (in particular, considering learners and teachers as audiences for analytics) so that it can have a larger impact. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This paper considers the issue of the locus of control in adaptive e-learning environments from the perspective of a new stakeholder; the instructional expert. With an ever increasing ability to gain insight into learners based on their online activities, instructors and instructional designers are poised to add value to the process of adaptation, a process normally reserved for either systems designers or the end user. This work describes the design of an e-learning system which provides automated analytics information to these experts for consideration, and then leverages the insights these experts have made as the basis for content and feature adaptation. © 2012 ACM.},

The power of social networking technology can also be leveraged to improve education and enhance the instructor and learner experience. Unlike conventional learning management systems, social software environments such as Athabasca Landing provide a persistent space and are flexible enough to support social and learner-led methods of informal, non-formal, and formal learning. Analytics can be used to effectively track and measure personal progress and help uncover extra-curricular factor affecting learner success such as network formation and growth. The paper reports on an attempt to explore this problem through analysis of student behaviour on the Athabasca Landing site within the context of a course. Its findings, explanation, and potential implications are listed. Effects of social learning on learners, based on the learner's behaviour before, during, and after the course are described and discussed. Finally, features of an open source tool created for this analysis, LASSIE is presented. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={A large body of research in the learning sciences has focused on students' commonsense science knowledge - the everyday knowledge of the natural world that is gained outside of formal instruction. Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, one-on-one clinical interviews have played a unique and central role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts, and coded by human analysts. In my team's work on learning analytics, we draw on this same type of data, but we attempt to automate its analysis. In this paper, I describe the success we have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics - methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode, as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this paper are primarily methodological in nature; I will attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews. As a test bed, I draw on transcripts of a corpus of interviews in which 54 middle school students were asked to explain the seasons. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This paper proposes that Social Learning Analytics (SLA) can be usefully thought of as a subset of learning analytics approaches. SLA focuses on how learners build knowledge together in their cultural and social settings. In the context of online social learning, it takes into account both formal and informal educational environments, including networks and communities. The paper introduces the broad rationale for SLA by reviewing some of the key drivers that make social learning so important today. Five forms of SLA are identified, including those which are inherently social, and others which have social dimensions. The paper goes on to describe early work towards implementing these analytics on SocialLearn, an online learning space in use at the UK's Open University, and the challenges that this is raising. This work takes an iterative approach to analytics, encouraging learners to respond to and help to shape not only the analytics but also their associated recommendations. © 2012 ACM.},

We describe Uatu, a system designed to visualize the real time contribution and edit history of collaboratively written documents. After briefly describing the technical details of this system, we offer initial findings from a fifteen week qualitative case study of 8 computer science students who used Uatu in conjunction with Google Docs while collaborating on a variety of writing and programming tasks. These findings indicate both the challenges and promise of delivering useful metrics for collaborative writing scenarios in academe and industry. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={While generic web analytics tend to focus on easily harvested quantitative data, Learning Analytics will often seek qualitative understanding of the context and meaning of this information. This is critical in the case of dialogue, which may be employed to share knowledge and jointly construct understandings, but which also involves many superficial exchanges. Previous studies have validated a particular pattern of 'exploratory dialogue' in learning environments to signify sharing, challenge, evaluation and careful consideration by participants. This study investigates the use of sociocultural discourse analysis to analyse synchronous text chat during an online conference. Key words and phrases indicative of exploratory dialogue were identified in these exchanges, and peaks of exploratory dialogue were associated with periods set aside for discussion and keynote speakers. Fewer individuals posted at these times, but meaningful discussion outweighed trivial exchanges. If further analysis confirms the validity of these markers as learning analytics, they could be used by recommendation engines to support learners and teachers in locating dialogue exchanges where deeper learning appears to be taking place. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The focus of this paper is to delineate and discuss design considerations for supporting teachers' dynamic diagnostic decision-making in classrooms of the 21st century. Based on the Next Generation Teaching Education and Learning for Life (NEXT-TELL) European Commission integrated project, we envision classrooms of the 21st century to (a) incorporate 1:1 computing, (b) provide computational as well as methodological support for teachers to design, deploy and assess learning activities and (c) immerse students in rich, personalized and varied learning activities in information ecologies resulting in high-performance, high-density, high-bandwidth, and data-rich classrooms. In contrast to existing research in educational data mining and learning analytics, our vision is to employ visual analytics techniques and tools to support teachers dynamic diagnostic pedagogical decision-making in real-time and in actual classrooms. The primary benefits of our vision is that learning analytics becomes an integral part of the teaching profession so that teachers can provide timely, meaningful, and actionable formative assessments to on-going learning activities in-situ. Integrating emerging developments in visual analytics and the established methodological approach of design-based research (DBR) in the learning sciences, we introduce a new method called "Teaching Analytics" and explore a triadic model of teaching analytics (TMTA). TMTA adapts and extends the Pair Analytics method in visual analytics which in turn was inspired by the pair programming model of the extreme programming paradigm. Our preliminary vision of TMTA consists of a collocated collaborative triad of a Teaching Expert (TE), a Visual Analytics Expert (VAE), and a Design-Based Research Expert (DBRE) analyzing, interpreting and acting upon real-time data being generated by students' learning activities by using a range of visual analytics tools. We propose an implementation of TMTA using open learner models (OLM) and conclude with an outline of future work. © 2011 ACM.},

This is difficult to extract from naturally occurring text, but the emergence of more-structured annotation and deliberation platforms for learning makes such information available. Using the Cohere web application as a research vehicle, we present examples of analytics at the level of individual learners and groups, showing conceptual and social network patterns, which we propose as indicators of meaningful learning. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The field of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) in general, has the potential to solve one of the most important challenges of our time: enable everyone to learn anything, anytime, anywhere. However, if we look back at more than 50 years of research in TEL, it is not clear where we are in terms of reaching our goal and whether we are, indeed, moving forward. The pace at which technology and new ideas evolve have created a rapid, even exponential, rate of change. This rapid change, together with the natural difficulty to measure the impact of technology in something as complex as learning, has lead to a field with abundance of new, good ideas and scarcity of evaluation studies. This lack of evaluation has resulted into the duplication of efforts and a sense of no "ground truth" or 'basic theory' of TEL. This article is an attempt to stop, look back and measure, if not the impact, at least the status of a small fraction of TEL, Learning Object Technologies, in the real world. The measured apparent inexistence of the reuse paradox, the two phase linear growth of repositories or the ineffective meta- data quality assessment of humans are clear reminders that even bright theoretical discussions do not compensate the lack of experimentation and measurement. Both theoretical and empirical studies should go hand in hand in order to advance the status of the field. This article is an invitation to other researchers in the field to apply Informetric techniques to measure, understand and apply in their tools the vast amount of information generated by the usage of Technology Enhanced Learning systems. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={In online learning environments, teachers and course designers often get little feedback about how students actually interact with and learn in online courses. Most of the learning systems used by educational institutions store comprehensive log data associated with students' behaviours and actions. However, these systems typically reveal or report on very general and limited information based on this data. In order to provide teachers and course designers with more detailed and meaningful information about students' behaviour and their use of learning resources within online courses, an analytics tool has been developed. The tool incorporates functionality to access and analyse data related to students' behaviours in learning systems. This tool can provide valuable information about students' learning processes allowing the identification of difficult or inappropriate learning material, and can therefore significantly contribute to the design of improved student support activities and resources. © 2011 ACM.},

With a goal of overall improvement in instructional effectiveness and identification of promising practices for inclusion in a learning activities design library, we propose the immediate and on-going monitoring of the effectiveness of learning activities, tutor facilitation and learner satisfaction during the course presentation. This has implications for constructively involving the learners and facilitators in the course improvement process. While originally conceived to reduce the time for pilot evaluation of new courses and learning activities, the proposed system could also be extended to individualized and blended learning environments, and if implemented using semantic web technologies, for research into the effectiveness of learning activity patterns. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) allow many users to explore the environment and interact with other users as they learn new content and share their knowledge with others. The semi-synchronous communicative interaction within these learning environments is typically text-based Internet relay chat (IRC). IRC data is stored in the form of chatlogs and can generate a large volume of data, posing a difficulty for researchers looking to evaluate learning in the interaction by analyzing and interpreting the patterns of communication structure and related content. This paper describes procedures for the measurement and visualization of chat-based communicative interaction in MUVEs. Methods are offered for structural analysis via social networks, and content analysis via semantic networks. Measuring and visualizing social and semantic networks allows for a window into the structure of learning communities, and also provides for a large cache of analytics to explore individual learning outcomes and group interaction in any virtual interaction. A case study on a learning based MUVE, SRI's Tapped-In community, is used to elaborate analytic methods. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={In recent years, studies into the reasons for dropping out of online higher education have been undertaken with greater regularity, parallel to the rise in the relative weight of this type of education, compared with brick-and-mortar education. However, the work invested in characterising the students who drop out of education, compared with those who do not, appears not to have had the same relevance as that invested in the analysis of the causes. The definition of dropping out is very sensitive to the context. In this article, we reach a purely empirical definition of student dropping out, based on the probability of not continuing a specific academic programme following several consecutive semesters of "theoretical break". Dropping out should be properly defined before analysing its causes, as well as comparing the drop-out rates between the different online programmes, or between online and on-campus ones. Our results show that there are significant differences among programmes, depending on their theoretical extension, but not their domain of knowledge. © 2011 ACM.},

SNAPP 2.0 includes the ability to view the evolution of participant interaction over time and annotate key events that occur along this timeline. This feature is useful in terms of monitoring network evolution and evaluating the impact of intervention strategies on student engagement and connectivity.

The objective of this article is to identify Westerman's [12] key arguments and apply them to the practice of Learning Analytics in educational interventions. The primary implication for Learning Analytics practitioners is the need to interpret quantitative analysis procedures at every phase from philosophy to conclusions. Furthermore, Learning Analytics practitioners and consumers must critically examine any assumption that suggests quantitative methodologies in Learning Analytics are inherently objective or that Learning Analytics algorithms may replace judgment rather than aid it. Lastly we propose a method for making observational data in virtual environments concrete through nested models. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Learning portals are education-oriented Web portals, which provide access to a variety of educational material, usually coming from various sources. In order to explore how they can support their users during an educational activity (e.g. preparation of teaching a course), it would be interesting to study the behavior of their visitors, focusing on the particular context in which specific actions are taking place. For example, user activities may be analyzed during specific learning events, when activities are more focused. This paper discusses the case study of the Organic.Edunet Web portal (www.organic-edunet.eu), a learning portal for organic agriculture educators that provides access to more than 10,500 learning resources from a federation of 11 institutional repositories. The portal mostly focuses on serving school teachers and university tutors and has attracted until today almost 42.200 unique visitors from more than 160 countries, out of which about 2.600 have registered to the portal. An effort is made to study the users' behavior, focusing in tutors and educators in both schools and universities, in relation to specific training events in which we know that they have been involved. Therefore, we analyze logs of user activities that took place on specific dates and geographical locations, in order to potentially identify notable changes in their normal visiting behavior. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Learning and knowledge creation is often distributed across multiple media and sites in networked environments. Traces of such activity may be fragmented across multiple logs and may not match analytic needs. As a result, the coherence of distributed interaction and emergent phenomena are analytically cloaked. Understanding distributed learning and knowledge creation requires multi-level analysis of the situated accomplishments of individuals and small groups and of how this local activity gives rise to larger phenomena in a network. We have developed an abstract transcript representation that provides a unified analytic artifact of distributed activity, and an analytic hierarchy that supports multiple levels of analysis. Log files are abstracted to directed graphs that record observed relationships (contingencies) between events, which may be interpreted as evidence of interaction and other influences between actors. Contingency graphs are further abstracted to two-mode directed graphs that record how associations between actors are mediated by digital artifacts and summarize sequential patterns of interaction. Transitive closure of these associograms creates sociograms, to which existing network analytic techniques may be applied, yielding aggregate results that can then be interpreted by reference to the other levels of analysis. We discuss how the analytic hierarchy bridges between levels of analysis and theory. © 2011 ACM.},
