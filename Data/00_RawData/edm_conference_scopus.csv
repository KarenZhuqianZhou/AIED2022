conference,Hicks2019568,"To address the changing landscape in educational assessment, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) transitions to digitally-based assessments (DBAs). DBAs permit the collection of data about how students progress through assessments, which was not feasible with paper-based assessments. The exploration of process data is a relatively new field, with most current studies focusing on response time analyses. This study will incorporate other process data information, such as the frequencies and durations of support functions used related to students' cognitive processes. Using data from one released block of the NAEP 2017 Mathematics Assessment for Grade 8, this study aims to provide an understanding of how students' use of support functions (e.g. drawing and highlighting) are related to response time (RT) and mathematics achievement. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Mbouzao2019611,"Massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) often rely on video as the prime choice of media content. Given their importance, it is no surprise that many studies that focus on the way students engage with the videos within the MOOC emerged in recent years. A methodology is introduced for the detailed analysis of student video watching patterns and compared with a prevailing approach. The method encodes video interaction sequences in a vector space model that defines distance measures between them. A pattern is defined as a centroid of sequences. We apply the method and conduct a study of how students interact with videos by analyzing interaction patterns across different videos. Within this method, the analysis of the influence of video on patterns is framed as a classification task based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Boosted Tree (GBM) and nearest neighbour approaches. The results reveal there is a significant difference in the patterns of interaction across videos. It demonstrates the usefulness of the methodology in comparison with a simpler and common approach. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Hutt201979,"We explore generalizability and fairness across sociodemographic groups for predicting on-time college graduation using a national dataset of 41,359 college applications. Our features include socio-demographics, institutional graduation rates, academic achievement, standardized test scores, engagement in extracurricular activities, and work experiences. We identify five latent classes based on available sociodemographic data and train Random Forest classifiers to successfully predict 4-year graduation. When individually trained and tested on each class using a split-half validation method, we achieved AUROCs between 0.629 and 0.694. We then evaluate how a model trained on the entire dataset performs on each latent class by performing a slicing analysis, finding a 6 to 10 percent improvement in AUROCs compared to the individual-class models. We explore fairness of our model by extending the slicing analysis to consider Absolute Between ROC Area (ABROCA), finding similar values for each of our latent classes. We contemplate how our results might be used to avoid perpetuating biases inherent in college application data. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Woodruff2019722,"Groups of schools face significant challenge to ensure that student assessment is consistent and valid, that predictions are accurate and that data policy does not adversely impact teacher workload. This study looked to determine if student outcomes at the end of secondary phase education in the UK, and by extension elsewhere in the world, could be reliably predicted. Data from two academic years, twenty-three secondary schools representing cohorts of approximately four thousand students were used to conduct comparative analysis on multiple machine learning experiments utilising Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and code written in Python. Findings indicate that Attainment 8, the main performance indicator used by the UK Department for Education, could be predicted by linear regression models and neural network approaches with an accuracy in line with human (teacher) predictions, and when combined with human predictions the models provided significant (P= 0.00039) gains on either approach in isolation. Seeking advice on further research particularly to introduce interactions to include a 'human in the loop' on model inputs, to refine feature selection, and to predict curriculum level variations in order for human intervention to occur early and improve outcomes. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Hu201969,"Student's academic performance prediction empowers educational technologies including academic trajectory and degree planning, course recommender systems, early warning and advising systems. Given a student's past data (such as grades in prior courses), the task of student's performance prediction is to predict a student's grades in future courses. Academic programs are structured in a way that prior courses lay the foundation for future courses. The knowledge required by courses is obtained by taking multiple prior courses, which exhibits complex relationships modeled by graph structures. Traditional methods for student's performance prediction usually neglect the underlying relationships between multiple courses; and how students acquire knowledge across them. In addition, traditional methods do not provide interpretation for predictions needed for decision making. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based graph convolutional networks model for student's performance prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset obtained from a large public university. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of grade prediction. The proposed model also shows strong accuracy in identifying students who are at-risk of failing or dropping out so that timely intervention and feedback can be provided to the student. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Jensen2019324,"Recent work in predictive modeling has called for increased scrutiny of how models generalize between different populations within the training data. Using interaction data from 69,174 students who used an online mathematics platform over an entire school year, we trained a sensor-free affect detection model and studied its generalizability to clusters of students based on typical platform use and demographic features. We show that models trained on one group perform similarly well when tested on the other groups, although there was a small advantage obtained by training individual subpopulation models compared to a general (all-population) model. Lastly, we perform a series of simulations to show how generalizability is affected by sample size. These results agree with our initial analysis that individual subpopulation models yield a small advantage over all-population models. Additionally, we show that training sizes smaller than 1,500 yield unstable models which make generalizability difficult to interpret. We discuss applications of this work in the context of developing large-scale affect detection models for diverse populations. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Doan2019288,"One of the essential problems, in educational data mining, is to predict students' performance on future learning materials, such as problems, assignments, and quizzes. Pioneer algorithms for predicting student performance mostly rely on two sources of information: students' past performance, and learning materials' domain knowledge model. The domain knowledge model, traditionally curated by domain experts, maps learning materials to concepts, topics, or knowledge components that are presented in them. However, creating a domain model by manually labeling the learning material can be a difficult and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization model for student performance prediction that does not rely on a predefined domain model. Our proposed algorithm models student knowledge as a soft membership of latent concepts. It also represents the knowledge acquisition process with an added rank-based constraint in the tensor factorization objective function. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in predicting student performance in two real-world datasets, and is robust to hyper-parameters. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Wiley2019675,"While automated essay evaluation techniques have dramatically reduced instructors' grading burden, they fall short of providing instructors with the rich qualitative insights into students' sense making process that a careful read of essays can afford. In this study, we demonstrate how word embedding techniques can serve as a complement to automated scoring, providing instructors with valuable near-time insight into how their students are conceptualizing targeted lesson concepts. For this study, we use a post-test essay associated with two Web-based Inquiry Science Enrivonment (WISE) units that provides instruction about how the sun causes increases in temperature. We create word2vec models fit to students' c-rater scored essay responses at each score level of a rubric designed to assess students' integrated understanding of targeted concepts. Using cosine similarity, we identify, with statistically reliability, the ideas that students at each score level of the rubric used in relation to the concepts targeted in the essay prompt. Our instructor interview reveals the validity of the results in providing insight into students' ideas, differentiated across understanding levels. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Raborn2019402,"Short forms of psychometric scales have been commonly used in educational and psychological research to reduce the burden of test administration. However, it is challenging to select items for a short form that preserve the validity and reliability of the scores of the original scale. This paper presents and evaluates multiple automated methods for scale short form creation based on metaheuristic optimization algorithms that incorporate validity criteria based on internal structure and relationships with other variables. The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, tabu search (TS), simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) are examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of scales with one factor, three factor, and bi-factor factorial structure. The results indicate that SA created short forms with best model fit for scales with one and three factor structures, but ACO was able to obtain highest reliability. For scales with bi-factor structure, SA provide short forms with best model fit, but TS obtained highest reliability. Overall, the SA algorithm is recommended because it produced consistently best model fit and reliability that was only slightly lower than the ACO or TS algorithms. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Kolb2019342,"Misconceptions have been an important area of study in STEM education towards improving our understanding of learners' construction of knowledge. The advent of large-scale tutoring systems has given rise to an abundance of data in the form of learner question-answer logs in which signatures of misconceptions can be mined. In this work, we explore the extent to which collected expert misconception diagnoses can be generalized to held-out questions to add misconception semantics. We attempt this generalization by way of a question-answer neural embedding trained on chronological sequences of learner answers. As part of our study, we collect natural language misconception diagnoses from math educators for a sampling of student answers to questions within four topics on Khan Academy. Drawing inspiration from machine translation, we use a multinomial logistic regression model to explore how well the expert misconception semantics, in the form of bag-of-words vectors, can be mapped onto the learned embedding space and interpolated. We evaluate the ability of the space to generalize expert diagnoses using three levels of cross-fold validation in which we measure the recall of predicted natural language diagnoses across rater, topics, and questions. We find that the embedding provides generalization performance substantially beyond baseline approaches. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Mandalapu2019607,"The increasing capabilities of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that collect student interaction data while learning mathematics at the middle school level have enabled researchers in educational data mining (EDM) to develop models that predict student career choice. Current research focuses on feature selection techniques that provide essential features in predicting the target variable. However, the factors that affect the prediction performance of an algorithm at a sample level could be studied in depth as they influence the overall performance of an algorithm. In this study, we analyze the influence of various attributes collected by the ASSISTments online learning platform on the performance of machine learning algorithms in predicting student career fields. Initially, we adopt a feature selection technique based on correlation, ID-ness, stability, and Missing values to determine useful attributes and then apply machine learning algorithms to classify student field. The trained models will be used to extract the supporting and contradicting attributes that influence the prediction performance of an algorithm. The results showed that the affect state confused played a significant role in supporting Non-STEM prediction, and boredom played a substantial role in contradicting STEM predictions while gaming the system influences both STEM and Non-STEM predictions.

conference,Shillo2019408,"Creativity is a dynamic process which generates ideas that are both novel and of value. However there is little understanding in what drives creativity in students and how to help teachers or education experts to detect creative thinking. This paper begins to address this gap by providing a platform and experiments for studying how creative outcomes can ensue over time. The platform is an open ended environment for creating geometrical shapes that supports exploration and trial and error. We show that participants exhibit diversity in their usage patterns in the system, and in particular, some exhibiting 'creative leaps' in which they move from creating a sequence of shapes in one category to another, new category. We designed a visualization tool that aids understanding in detecting these aspects in students' work. We provide a basic computational model that is able to predict whether a student will create a new shape at a given point in time. The impact of this work is in beginning to provide tools for promoting creativity in students and directing their interactions in a way that facilitates the creative process. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Jacobsen2019580,"Finding the perfect job that takes into account someone's skills and ambitions is an overwhelming challenge for many freshly graduated students. At the same time, companies struggle to hire employees fulfilling their requirements. Ideally, a successful match of students and jobs includes the preferences of both sides. This paper proposes a reciprocal recommender system matching graduating students and job offers. To construct a common representation space for the items of the recommendation, the course descriptions from the curriculum are used as a linking factor. Further, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to extract topics from the course and job descriptions, forming the latent representation space. Next to providing job recommendations, curricula gaps can be discovered and thus the students can be better prepared for a future career. The algorithm is tested on data from a Data Science bachelor programme. Results show that a reciprocal matching of graduating students and jobs generates recommendations with precision and recall up to 0.7. The approach yields promising results for such system to be implemented as a job recommender system on university level or as a stand-alone system for graduating students. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Shimada2019178,"In this paper, we focus on optimizing the assignment of students to courses. The target courses are conducted by different teachers using the same syllabus, course design, and lecture materials. More than 1,300 students are mechanically assigned to one of ten courses taught by different teachers. Therefore, mismatches often occur between students' learning behavior patterns and teachers' approach to teaching. As a result, students may be less satisfied, have a lower level of understanding of the material, and achieve less. To solve these problems, we propose a strategy to optimize the assignment of students to courses based on learning activity analytics. The contributions of this study are 1) clarifying the relationship between learning behavior pattern and teaching based on learning activity analytics using large-scale educational data, 2) optimizing the assignment of students to courses based on learning behavior pattern analytics, and 3) demonstrating the effectiveness of assignment optimization via simulation experiments. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Sunahase2019426,"Peer assessment is a promising solution for scaling up the grading of a large number of submissions. The reliability of evaluations is one of the critical issues in peer assessment; several probabilistic models have been proposed for obtaining reliable grades from peers. Peer correction is a similar framework, in which students are instructed to correct the errors in submissions from other students. Peer correction is typically performed simultaneously with peer assessment; a reviewer is instructed to correct the errors in a submission and to provide a grade to it. We observe the occasional inconsistency between a grade and the correction; for example, a reviewer provides a high grade for a submission but she corrects many errors in it. Such inconsistencies can point to unreliable reviewers. In this paper, we propose probabilistic models for peer correction, and the combination of the peer correction models and the existing peer assessment models for capturing the inconsistency to accurately estimate the reviewer reliability and the student ability. We conduct experiments using the dataset of an actual peer correction platform for language translation, and the results demonstrate that the combination of peer correction models and peer assessment models improves the accuracy of the student ability estimation. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Botelho2019508,"There is a long history of research on the development of models to detect and study student behavior and affect. Developing computer-based models has allowed the study of learning constructs at fine levels of granularity and over long periods of time. For many years, these models were developed using features based on previous educational research from the raw log data. More recently, however, the application of deep learning models has often skipped this feature-engineering step by allowing the algorithm to learn features from the fine-grained raw log data. As many of these deep learning models have led to promising results, researchers have asked which situations may lead to machine-learned features performing better than expert-generated features. This work addresses this question by comparing the use of machine-learned and expert-engineered features for three previously-developed models of student affect, off-task behavior, and gaming the system. In addition, we propose a third feature-engineering method that combines expert features with machine learning to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches to build detectors of student affect and unproductive behaviors. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Nanda2019619,"In this paper, we propose and evaluate a decision support system (DSS) to predict the topic of discussion forum posts among categories: Social, Concept, Assignment, and Others, in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The DSS uses two supervised machine learning (ML) models-Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naïve Bayes to output: two most-likely categories with associated prediction probabilities, and a surety indicator (High, Medium, or Low) of prediction. We evaluated the DSS on manually-labelled discussion posts from two programming related MOOCs offered on different platforms and the ML models being trained on the same and different course. Our results indicate that: a) the prediction performance of DSS is better when trained on labelled data from the same course, b) when trained on data from another course, the DSS performs better if training data is sampled to reduce the bias in distribution of categories, and c) providing the two most-likely categories is helpful for indicating the smaller categories that are usually difficult to predict by ML models. This DSS can help instructional teams to better manage the MOOC discussion forum and learners to easily navigate and find relevant posts. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Venant2019188,"The evaluation of text complexity is an important topic in education. While this objective has been addressed by approaches using lexical and syntactic analysis for decades, semantic complexity is less common, and the recent research works that tackle this question rely on machine learning algorithms that are hardly explainable and are not specifically designed to measure this variable. To address this issue, we explore in this paper the engineering of novel features to evaluate conceptual complexity. Through the construction of a knowledge graph that captures the concepts present in a text and their generalized forms, we measure different graph-based metrics to express such a complexity. Eventually, early-stage evaluations based on a well-known public corpus of students' productions show that the use of these metrics significantly improves performance compared to a state-of-the-art binary neural network classifier. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Morsy2019366,"Grade prediction for future courses not yet taken by students is important as it can help them and their advisers during the process of course selection as well as for designing personalized degree plans and modifying them based on their performance. One of the successful approaches for accurately predicting a student's grades in future courses is Cumulative Knowledge-based Regression Models (CKRM). CKRM learns shallow linear models that predict a student's grades as the similarity between his/her knowledge state and the target course. A student's knowledge state is built by linearly accumulating the learned provided knowledge components of the courses he/she has taken in the past, weighted by his/her grades in them. However, not all the prior courses contribute equally to the target course. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Attentive Knowledge-based model (NAK) that learns the importance of each historical course in predicting the grade of a target course. Compared to CKRM and other competing approaches, our experiments on a large real-world dataset consisting of ∼1.5 grades show the effectiveness of the proposed NAK model in accurately predicting the students' grades. Moreover, the attention weights learned by the model can be helpful in better designing their degree plans. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Arthurs2019252,"Understanding exam score distributions has implications for item response theory (IRT), grade curving, and downstream modeling tasks such as peer grading. Historically, grades have been assumed to be normally distributed, and to this day the normal is the ubiquitous choice for modeling exam scores. While this is a good assumption for tests comprised of equally-weighted dichotomous items, it breaks down on the highly polytomous domain of undergraduate-level exams. The logit-normal is a natural alternative because it is has a bounded range, can represent asymmetric distributions, and lines up with IRT models that perform logistic transformations on normally distributed abilities. To tackle this question, we analyze an anonymized dataset from Gradescope consisting of over 4000 highly polytomous undergraduate exams. We show that the logit-normal better models this data without having more parameters than the normal. In addition, we propose a new continuous polyto-mous IRT model that reduces the number of item-parameters by using a logit-normal assumption at the item level. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Nguyen2019702,"A key issue in mathematics learning and instruction is supporting high-school students in developing problem-solving skills, which can foster creativity, innovation, and ultimately lead to success in the workplace. Towards this goal, a crucial first step is modeling students' problem-solving skills, so that effective instructions and interventions can be designed to meet their learning needs. We propose three steps to explore this direction in the domain of nonroutine mathematics problems - those that cannot be solved by a textbook procedure but require insight and resourcefulness. First, we construct a conceptual framework of the most common problem-solving strategies that our instruction and modeling process will be based on. Second, we conduct a pilot study to test whether the framework can help students generate multiple solution strategies. Third, we use natural language processing and crowdsourcing to support automated assessment of students' inputs and explanations. These three steps will contribute to an educational platform that can be deployed at scale to assist students in solving non-routine mathematics problem and serve as a blueprint for problem-solving instructions in other domains. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Azizsoltani2019766,"Advances in the tutoring systems present a unique opportunity for effective and cost-efficient tutoring for the students. Such tutoring systems produce a large amount of educational data. Therefore, there is a growing need for data-driven learning techniques applicable to the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) [4, 7, 18]. One of the goals of ITSs is to improve the traditional education methods by providing individualized tutoring for every student, from underrepresented ones to those with high competency level. Reinforcement Learning (RL) [20] provides a data-driven approach to personalize the learning environment for each student in a cost and time effective way [11, 13]. Such an inexpensive, personalized and data-driven approach provides an opportunity for every student based on their level of competency [23]. However, several major challenges need to be addressed for the induction of an effective RL policy. For example, one of the major challenges lies in the definition of the states, actions, and rewards in the educational domain. It is known to the community that the data collected by the tutoring systems is usually noisy, and the rewards, such as learning gain, are only available with a significant amount of delay. When the immediate reward is not observable, inducing an effectiveness offline RL policy is challenging. One example of this is when we measure the performance of students in the exam they take at the end of the semester. On top of that, there are several sources of uncertainty in educational training data. For example, the student's learning state is not completely observable. At the same time, the student's interaction with the tutoring system is not deterministic which makes the training data noisy. In this workshop, we discuss the issues to induce effective policies for educational purposes in the presence of uncertainty and delayed rewards. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Moore2019360,"Educational systems use models of student skill to inform decision-making processes. Defining such models manually is challenging due to the large number of relevant factors. We propose learning multidimensional representations (em-beddings) from student activity data - these are fixed-length real vectors with three desirable characteristics: co-location of similar students and items in a vector space; magnitude increases with skill, and that absence of a skill can be represented. Based on the Multicomponent Latent Trait Model, we use a neural network with complementary trainable weights to learn these embeddings by backpropagation. We evaluate using synthetic student activity data that provides a ground-truth of student skills in order to understand the impact of number of students, question items and knowledge components in the domain. We find that our data-mined parameter values can recreate the synthetic datasets up to the accuracy of the model that generated them, for domains with up to 10 simultaneously active knowledge components, which can be effectively mined using relatively small quantities of data (1000 students, 100 items). We describe a procedure to estimate the number of components in a domain, and propose a component-masking logic mechanism that improves performance on high-dimensional datasets. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Yang2019208,"""Sensor-free"" detectors of student affect that use only student activity data and no physical or physiological sensors are cost-effective and have potential to be applied at large scale in real classrooms. These detectors are trained using student affect labels collected from human observers as they observe students learn within intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) in real classrooms. Due to the inherent diversity of student activity and affect dynamics, observing the affective states of some students at certain times is likely to be more informative to the affect detectors than observing others. Therefore, a carefully-crafted observation schedule may lead to more meaningful observations and improved affect detectors. In this paper, we investigate whether active (machine) learning methods, a family of methods that adaptively select the next most informative observation, can improve the efficiency of the affect label collection process. We study several existing active learning methods and also propose a new method that is ideally suited for the problem setting in affect detection. We conduct a series of experiments using a real-world student affect dataset collected in real classrooms deploying the ASSISTments ITS. Results show that some active learning methods can lead to high-quality affect detectors using only a small number of highly informative observations. We also discuss how to deploy active learning methods in real classrooms to improve the affect label collection process and thus sensor-free affect detectors. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Shaikh2019647,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be embedded in educational technologies to evaluate how interventions affect student outcomes and how effectiveness varies with characteristics like prior knowledge. But RCTs often assign many students to ineffective conditions. Adaptive algorithms like contextual multi-armed bandits (MABs) could change how students are assigned to conditions over time, offering the potential to both evaluate effectiveness for subgroups of students and direct more students to interventions that are effective for them. We use simulations to compare contextual MABs to traditional RCTs and non-contextual MABs. Contextual MABs improve outcomes for each subgroup; in contrast, non-contextual MABs may help one group of students, such as those with high prior knowledge, while hurting another. Because both MAB algorithms adaptively assign conditions based on prior students' results, both recover biased estimates of condition effectiveness. However data collected from a contextual MAB is still nearly as good for inferring the optimal assignment policy as from an RCT. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Ikeda2019576,"In blended learning, it is meaningful to obtain data on and understand the nature of the usage of web-based teaching materials by individual students and by whole classes in progress.

MCTA1 provides functions that collect specific granularity as subsections and visualize the result of analysis in real time. Through the application of this system in real classes, particularly in programming practice lessons, it became clear that the behavior of the mouse cursor was an effective source of information for determining how individual students and whole classes actually use the web-based teaching materials.

In our first experiment, we replicate the original authors' methodology as precisely as possible in collaboration with the original authors. In a second experiment, we demonstrate that this initial experiment likely overestimates the generalization performance of the proposed model due to the design of its validation. In a third experiment, we attempt to achieve the previously-reported performance in a more difficult, but more relevant, hold-out set design by exploring a large space of model regularization configurations. We demonstrate that we can reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance of the model, but cannot achieve the previously-reported level of performance.

conference,Wang2019714,"Recent work [16] has demonstrated the superior quality of questions generated by state-of-the-art neural question generation algorithms. However, evaluating the quality of these questions typically requires a domain expert which is labor intensive and costly. We therefore seek an reliable and automatic method to evaluate the quality of the questions. To this end, we propose a simple evaluation criterion, NLL-QA, to replace the negative log likelihood (NLL) criterion universally employed in state-of-the-art neural question generation models to evaluate and select the final output question. Preliminary results demonstrate that, compared to the traditional negative log likelihood criterion, NLL-QA enables neural question generation models to select better questions that are more relevant to the input answer without sacrificing grammatical correctness. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

It evaluates the potential of deep learning and state-of-the-art NLP tools in automated essay scoring (AES) to predict not only holistic scores but also the finer-grained rubric scores, an area underexplored but essential to provision formative feedback and uncover the AI reasoning behind AES. For comparison purpose, this paper advocates the need for transparency when sharing AES processes and outcomes. Finally, it reveals the insufficiency of ASAP essay datasets to train generalizable AES models by examining the distributions of holistic and rubric scores. Findings show that the strength of agreement between human and machine graders on holistic scores does not translate into similar strength on rubric scores and that the learning made by the machine barely exceeds the performance of a naïve predictor. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Liang2019348,"Strict partial order is a mathematical structure commonly seen in relational data. One obstacle to extracting such type of relations at scale is the lack of large scale labels for building effective data-driven solutions. We develop an active learning framework for mining such relations subject to a strict order. Our approach incorporates relational reasoning not only in finding new unlabeled pairs whose labels can be deduced from an existing label set, but also in devising new query strategies that consider the relational structure of labels. Our experiments on concept prerequisite relations show our proposed framework can substantially improve the classification performance with the same query budget compared to other baseline approaches. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Broisin2019270,"How to support students in programming learning has been a great research challenge in the last years. To address this challenge, prior works have mainly focused on proposing solutions based on syntactic analysis to provide students with personalized feedback about their grammatical programming errors and misconceptions. However, syntactic analysis falls short on informing learners how they solve the programming problem, even if one key learning outcome of programming relates to the development of an individual's ability to solve a problem. In this article, we introduce an indicator to analyze beginners' code based on semantic proximity. This indicator adapts an edit distance algorithm (i.e., the Levenshtein distance) to express the proximity of the students' code with the expected solution provided by the teacher, in order to express the learners' capacity to solve the given problem. To process our indicator, we applied machine learning techniques to a dataset from an introductory programming course with a sample of 166 students. The first results are encouraging. On the one hand, the semantic indicator can be used to automatically classify source codes as semantically correct or incorrect in 58% of the cases. On the other hand, the indicator is correlated with teachers' summative evaluations of students' codes. Even if further investigations must be conducted to improve the indicator's accuracy, the results of this study make it possible to use our approach as the foundations for future research in semantic-based intelligent and awareness programming systems. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Guthrie2019560,"Many existing studies analyzing log data from online learning platforms model events such as accessing a webpage or problem solving as simple binary states. In this study, we combine quality information inferred from the duration of each event with the conventional binary states, distinguishing abnormally brief events from normal or extra-long events. The new event records, obtained from students' interaction with 10 online learning modules, can be seen as a special form of language, with each ""word"" describing a student's state of interaction with one learning module, and each ""sentence"" capturing the interaction with the entire sequence. We used second order Markov chains to learn the patterns of this new ""language,"" with each chain using the interaction states on two given modules to indicate the interaction states on the following two modules. By visualizing the Markov chains that lead to interaction states associated with either disengagement or high levels of engagement, we observed that: 1) disengagement occurs more frequently towards the end of the 10 module sequence; 2) interaction states associated with the highest level of learning effort rarely leads to disengaged states; and 3) states containing brief learning events frequently lead to disengaged states. One advantage of our approach is that it can be applied to log data with relatively small numbers of events, which is common for many online learning systems in college level STEM disciplines. Combining quality information with event logs is a simple attempt at incorporating students' internal condition into learning analytics. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Ausin2019168,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been shown to be a very powerful technique in recent years on a wide range of applications. Much of the prior DRL work took the online learning approach. However, given the challenges of building accurate simulations for modeling student learning, we investigated applying DRL to induce a pedagogical policy through an offline approach. In this work, we explored the effectiveness of offline DRL for pedagogical policy induction in an Intelligent Tutoring System. Generally speaking, when applying offline DRL, we face two major challenges: one is limited training data and the other is the credit assignment problem caused by delayed rewards. In this work, we used Gaussian Processes to solve the credit assignment problem by estimating the inferred immediate rewards from the final delayed rewards. We then applied the DQN and Double-DQN algorithms to induce adaptive pedagogical strategies tailored to individual students. Our empirical results show that without solving the credit assignment problem, the DQN policy, although better than Double-DQN, was no better than a random policy. However, when combining DQN with the inferred rewards, our best DQN policy can outperform the random yet reasonable policy, especially for students with high pre-test scores. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Aguerrebere2019234,"We analyze teachers' written feedback to students in an online learning environment, specifically a setting in which high school students in Uruguay are learning English as a foreign language. How complex should teachers' feedback be? Should it be adapted to each student's English proficiency level? How does teacher feedback affect the probability of engaging the student in a conversation? To explore these questions, we conducted both parametric (multilevel modeling) and non-parametric (bootstrapping) analyses of 27,627 messages exchanged between 35 teachers and 1074 students in 2017 and 2018. Our results suggest: (1) Teachers should adapt their feedback complexity to their students' English proficiency level. Students who receive feedback that is too complex or too basic for their level post 13-15% fewer comments than those who receive adapted feedback. (2) Feedback that includes a question is associated with higher odds-ratio (17.5-19) of engaging the student in conversation. (3) For students with low English proficiency, slow turnaround (feedback after 1 week) reduces this odds ratio by 0.7. These results have potential implications for online platforms offering foreign language learning services, in which it is crucial to give the best possible learning experience while judiciously allocating teachers' time. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

We then analyze how these types of posts and their social connections can be used to predict the students' final course performance. Pursuant to this work we developed a binary classifier to identify on- and off-topic posts and applied our analysis with the hand-coded and predicted labels.

While these so call ""zero-parameter"" models have been successful in modeling student learning in intelligent tutoring systems they still show systematic deviation from human learning performance. One deviation stems from the computational models' lack of prior knowledge-all models start off as a blank slate-leading to substantial differences in performance at the first practice opportunity.

Students who enrolled in the same course may have completely different purposes and different interest. Employing the enrollment record data from Kyushu University, we conduct a systematic investigation on the course-taking pattern for recommendation. We then discuss the challenges to recommend suitable courses in university and propose a preliminary approach to address the challenges by designing a course recommendation mechanism based on association rule of previous course-taking pattern together with student interest. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Dickler2019536,"The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS [14]) emphasize inquiry practices that students should master including constructing explanations. Most automated methods for scoring scientific explanations, however, do not detect the specific components involved in constructing explanations in the claim, evidence, and reasoning (CER) format, which is commonly used in science classes (cf. [12]). In this study, we expanded and implemented a data-driven, regular expression-based method to automatically score students' written CER explanations across the domains of Physical Science, Earth Science, and Life Science in the intelligent tutoring system, Inq-ITS. We then investigated the generalizability of our method using a new set of testing data. Results of comparisons between human scores and automated scores indicated high performance for the method when applied to the testing data. Analyses showed that the automated scoring for one domain (earth science) had lower performance relative to other domains. Overall, the fine-grained, data-driven, regular expression-based method yielded high accuracy and more reliable scores relative to human scores.

conference,Yahya2019484,"In outcome-based academic programs, Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) and Student Outcomes (SOs) are two cores, which are mapped to each other in a hierarchical manner. This psaper presents a novel application of educational data mining to discover useful knowledge on these components. More specifically, it applies association rule mining techniques to discover mapping rules between PEOs and SOs and correlation rules among SOs. As a case study, this paper demonstrates how association rule mining techniques is applied to discover PEO-SOs mapping rules and SOs correlation rules in engineering programs. To this end, a set of 152 self-study reports of engineering programs, accredited by American Board for Engineering and Technology-Engineering Accreditation Commission (ABET-EAC), have been collected and the mapping data between their PEOs and ABET-EAC SOs have been extracted. The dataset has been processed and transformed into a representation suitable for association rule mining techniques. This involves identifying a set of PEOs labels, annotating data instances with PEOs labels, and projecting each multi-label data instance into a set of single-label instances. Apriori algorithm is then applied to generate rules involving PEOs and SOs. The generated rules are then filtered to obtain mapping rules between PEOs and ABET-EAC SOs and the correlation rules among SOs. The filtered rules are then used to draw a set of generic rules for mapping each PEO to ABET-EAC SOs and to figure out potential correlations exist among ABET-EAC SOs. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Chen201919,"For the development of successful human-agent dialogue-based tutoring systems, it is essential to understand what makes a human-human tutorial dialogue successful. While there has been much research on dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems, there have been comparatively fewer studies on analyzing large-scale datasets of human-human online tutoring dialogues. A critical indicator of success of a tutoring dialogue can be student satisfaction, which is the focus of the study reported in the paper. Specifically, we used a large-scale dataset, which consisted of over 15,000 tutorial dialogues generated by human tutors and students in a mobile app-based tutoring service. An extensive analysis of the dataset was performed to identify factors relevant to student satisfaction in online tutoring systems. The study also engineered a set of 325 features as input to a Gradient Tree Boosting model to predict tutoring success. Experimental results revealed that (i) in a tutorial dialogue, factors such as efforts spent by both tutors and students, utterance informativeness and tutor responsiveness were positively correlated with student satisfaction; and (ii) Gradient Tree Boosting model could effectively predict tutoring success, especially with utterances from the later period of a dialogue, but more research effort is needed to improve the prediction performance. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Anderson2019488,"Predictive and data-intensive modeling has rapidly gained prominence in many research fields over the past decade. In recent years, the fairness of analytical models has become an increasingly important question for researchers: might a model systematically underperform on certain demographics? Might its application have different impacts across different demographic groups? Recently, these questions have found their way into educational research as well, where predictive and statistical modeling is used for such purposes as predicting course completion, assisting university recruitment, and proactively offering assistance to students. If such models are potentially unfair, students may remain under-served or suffer potential harm as a result. In this paper, we demonstrate two post-hoc assessments of fairness, applied to existing models predicting student graduation. Our assessments are intended to check for, rather than proactively prevent, algorithmic bias in predictive models. The first assessment investigates whether a selected model is equitable: does its performance systematically differ for members of different demographic groups? The second investigates whether the decision to use one model for all individuals in a given dataset is optimal: does using one model for all students come at a significant loss in per-group accuracy? By assessing fairness systematically, we hope to reduce to the risk of inequities from predictive analytics in education. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Zhang2019468,"""Wheel spinning"" is the phenomenon in which a student fails to master a Knowledge Component (KC), despite significant practice. Ideally, an intelligent tutoring system would detect this phenomenon early, so that the system or a teacher could try alternative instructional strategies. Prior work has put forward several criteria for wheel spinning and has demonstrated that wheel spinning can be detected reasonably early. Yet the literature lacks systematic comparisons among the multiple wheel spinning criteria, features, and models that have been proposed, across multiple evaluation criteria (e.g., earliness, precision, and generalizability) and datasets. In our experiments, we constructed six wheel spinning detectors and compared their performance under two different wheel spinning criteria with three datasets. The results show that two prominent criteria for wheel spinning diverge substantially, and that a Random Forest model has the most consistent performance in early detection of wheel spinning across datasets and wheel spinning criteria. In addition, we found that a simple model overlooked by previous research (Logistic Regression trained on a single feature) is able to detect wheel spinning at an early stage with decent performance. This work brings us closer to unifying strands of prior work on wheel spinning (e.g., understanding how different criteria compare) and to early detection of wheel spinning in educational practice. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Coleman2019732,"Determining which students are at risk of poorer outcomes-such as dropping out, failing classes, or decreasing standardized examination scores - has become an important area of research and practice in both K-12 and higher education. The detectors produced from this type of predictive modeling research are increasingly used in early warning systems to identify which students are at risk and intervene to support better outcomes. In K-12, it has become common practice to re-build and validate these detectors, district-by-district, due to different data semantics and risk factors for students in different districts. As these detectors become more widely used, however, it becomes desirable to also apply detectors in school districts without sufficient historical data to build a district-specific model. Novel approaches that can address the complex data challenges a new district presents are critical for extending the benefits of early warning systems to all students. Using an ensemble-based algorithm, we evaluate a model averaging approach that can generate a useful model for previously-unseen districts. During the ensembling process, our approach builds models for districts that have a significant amount of historical records and integrates them through averaging. We then use these models to generate predictions for districts suffering from high data missingness. Using this approach, we are able to predict student-at-risk status effectively for unseen districts, across a range of grade ranges, and achieve prediction goodness comparable to previously published models predicting at-risk. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Ai2019240,"Personalized education systems recommend learning contents to students based on their capacity to accelerate their learning. This paper proposes a personalized exercise recommendation system for online self-directed learning. We first improve the performance of knowledge tracing models. Existing deep knowledge tracing models, such as Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN), ignore exercises' concept tags, which are usually available in tutoring systems. We modify DKVMN to design its memory structure based on the course's concept list, and explicitly consider the exercise-concept mapping relationship during students' knowledge tracing. We evaluated the model on the 5th grade students' math exercising dataset in TAL, one of the biggest education groups in China, and found that our model has higher performance than existing models. We also enhance the DKVMN model to support more input features and obtain higher performance. Second, we use the model to build a student simulator, and use it to train an exercise recommendation policy with deep reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that our policy achieves better performance than existing heuristic policy in terms of maximizing the students' knowledge level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that deep reinforcement learning has been applied to personalized mathematic exercise recommendation. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Wang2019671,"Knowledge tracing is an essential and challenging task in intelligent tutoring systems, whose goal is to estimate students' knowledge state based on their responses to questions. Although many models for knowledge tracing task are developed, most of them depend on either concepts or items as input and ignore the hierarchical structure of items, which provides valuable information for the prediction of student learning results. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hierarchical knowledge tracing (DHKT) model exploiting the hierarchical structure of items. In the proposed DHKT model, the hierarchical relations between concepts and items are modeled by the hinge loss on the inner product between the learned concept embeddings and item embeddings. Then the learned embeddings are fed into a neural network to model the learning process of students, which is used to make predictions. The prediction loss and the hinge loss are minimized simultaneously during training process. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

Yet, the abundance of courses available and the highly personalized curriculum are often overwhelming for students who must select courses relevant to their academic interests and suitable to their academic background. This paper presents the course recommender system that we have developed for the Liberal Arts bachelor of the University College Maastricht, the Netherlands. It aims to complement academic advising and help students make better-informed course selections. The system recommends courses whose content best matches the student's academic interests, issues warnings for courses that are too advanced given the student's academic background and, in the latter case, suggests suitable preparatory courses. We base the course recommendations on a topic model fitted on course descriptions, and the warnings on a sparse predictive model for grade based on students' past academic performance and level of academic expertise. Preparatory courses consist of courses whose content has the best preparatory value according to the predictive model. We find that course recommendations are relevant for a wide range of academic interests present in the student population and that students found recommendations for courses at other departments especially helpful. The preparatory courses often lack coherence with the target course and need to be improved. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a human-machine hybrid peer-grading framework, including an automatic grader to ensure reasonable peer grades before the Bayesian models are utilized to infer the true scores. This framework can significantly eliminate the severely biased grades by those undutiful students, and thus improve the accuracy of the true-score estimation in the Bayesian peer-grading models. Both simulated and real peer-grading datasets in our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this new framework for SPOCs. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Kang2019336,"Collaborative problem-solving (CPS) as a key competency required in the 21st century. There has been an increasing need to understand CPS since it involves not only cognitive but also social processes, and thus its process is difficult to examine. Recent research has highlighted that computer-based learning environments provide an opportunity for students to collaborate with others to solve scientific problems and facilitate their knowledge building process, which can be dynamically tracked within the systems. However, limited research has attempted to identify CPS process captured in the computer-based learning environments designed for supporting CPS. This study therefore aimed to investigate students' CPS process in a serious game, Alien Rescue, by analyzing a student's daily tool use action sequence generated in the game. First, we computed a daily gameplay action similarity among students in a group using a similarity coefficient, Jaccard (Jac). Each group's Jac coefficients over the entire gameplay period (i.e. six days over three weeks) were considered as the group action similarity trajectory. The Jac coefficient of each day was entered as a single feature (i.e. a total of six features) to conduct a KmL cluster analysis that clusters longitudinal data. Three clusters of groups with similar behavior traits (i.e. group action similarity trajectories) were identified. The groups' background information (e.g. solution scores, knowledge gain scores) further provided how the groups' CPS traits can be related to their learning performance. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Ju2019595,"For many forms of e-learning environments, the system's behaviors can be viewed as a sequential decision process wherein, at each discrete step, the system is responsible for deciding the next system action when there are multiple ones available. Each of these system decisions affects the user's successive actions and performance and some of them are more important than others. Thus, this raises an open question: how can we identify the critical system interactive decisions that are linked to student learning from a long trajectory of decisions? In this work, we proposed and evaluated Critical-Reinforcement Learning (Critical-RL), an adversarial deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) based framework to identify critical decisions and induce compact yet effective policies. Specifically, it induces a pair of adversarial policies based upon Deep Q-Network (DQN) with opposite goals: one is to improve student learning while the other is to hinder; critical decisions are identified by comparing the two adversarial policies and using their corresponding Q-value differences; finally, a Critical policy is induced by giving optimal action on critical decisions but random yet reasonable decisions on others. We evaluated the effectiveness of Critical policy against a random yet reasonable (Random) policy. While no significant difference was found between the two condition, it is probably because of small sample sizes. Much to our surprise, we found that students often experience so-called Critical phase: a consecutive sequence of critical decisions with the same action. Students were further divided into High vs. Low based on the number of Critical phases they experienced and our results showed that while no significant was found between the two Low groups, the High Critical group learned significantly more than the High Random group. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Jiang201989,"Thermal comfort (TC) - how comfortable or satisfied a person is with the temperature of her/his surroundings - is one of the key factors influencing the indoor environmental quality of schools, libraries, and offices. We conducted an experiment to explore how TC can impact students' learning. University students (n = 25) were randomly assigned to different temperature conditions in an office environment (25°C → 30°C, or 30°C → 25°C) that were implemented using a combination of heaters and air conditioners over a 1.25 hour session. The task of the participants was to learn from tutorial videos on three different topics, and a test was given after each tutorial. The results suggest that (1) changing the room temperature by a few degrees Celsius can stat. sig. impact students' self-reported TC; (2) the relationship between TC and learning exhibited an inverted U-curve, i.e., should be neither too uncomfortable nor too comfortable. We also explored different computer vision and sensor-based approaches to measure students' thermal comfort automatically. We found that (3) TC can be predicted automatically either from the room temperature or from an infra-red (IR) camera of the face; however, (4) TC prediction from a normal (visible-light) web camera is highly challenging, and only limited predictive power was found in the facial expression features to predict thermal comfort. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

We also introduce positivity as a measure to study the valence reported by students chronologically, and use it to derive insights into their emotion patterns and their association with learning outcomes.

conference,Aulck20199,"Each year, roughly 30% of first-year students at US baccalaureate institutions do not return for their second year and billions of dollars are spent educating these students. Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. What's more, most of the previous attempts to model attrition at traditional campuses using machine learning have focused on small, homogeneous groups of students. In this work, we model student attrition using a dataset that is composed almost exclusively of information routinely collected for record-keeping at a large, public US university. By examining the entirety of the university's student body and not a subset thereof, we use one of the largest known datasets for examining attrition at a public US university (N = 66,060). Our results show that students' second year re-enrollment and eventual graduation can be accurately predicted based on a single year of data (AUROCs = 0.887 and 0.811, respectively). We find that demographic data (such as race, gender, etc.) and pre-admission data (such as high school academics, entrance exam scores, etc.) - upon which most admissions processes are predicated - are not nearly as useful as early college performance/transcript data for these predictions. These results highlight the potential for data mining to impact student retention and success at traditional campuses. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

Prior work has tried to create systems for second language learners (L2) to learn Mandarin tones, but such work does not often have a well-determined algorithm to choose items for practice. In order to develop a model for adaptive practice selection, we designed an experiment and asked L2 learners on Amazon Turk to finish a series of tone learning trials. Using this data we ranked the difficulty level of the stimuli and incorporated a quadratic function of difficulty for prior successes and failures into the Performance Factors Analysis (PFA) model. Results of logistic regression were used to compute the optimal difficulty level for each tone. For the four Mandarin tones, the optimal difficulty scores were 0.86, 0.75, 0.54 and 0.60, respectively. Crossvalidated results showed that the new PFA-Difficulty model had better performance than the original PFA model. While the advantage was not large, the new model allows for clear inferences about optimal item difficulty that can be used by an adaptive training system to select items for practice. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Wang2019450,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become more and more popular recently. These courses have attracted a large number of students world-wide. In a popular course, there may be thousands of students. Such a large number of students in one course makes it infeasible for the instructors to grade all the submissions. Peer assessment is thus an effective paradigm that can help grade the submissions at a large scale. However, due to the variance in the ability and standard of the student graders, peer grades may be noisy and biased. Aggregating peer grades to have an accurate and fair final grade for a submission is a challenging problem because the reliability and bias degrees of graders are usually unknown in practice. To address this issue, some probabilistic models considering the graders' reliability and bias are proposed. However, due to the sparsity of peer grade observations, it is difficult for these models to estimate the accurate reliability and bias of the graders as well as the true grades of the submissions. Compared with absolute peer grades, the relative peer grades, derived from the difference between the peer grades of two submissions graded by the same grader, are less sparse and more robust to the grader's bias. Thus relative peer grades are informative and helpful in cardinal peer grading estimation whose goal is to estimate the absolute numeric grades of submissions. In this paper, we propose two new probabilistic models to help improve the accuracy of cardinal peer grading estimation using the observed relative grades among submissions. In this way, the relation between the true grades among submissions is taken into consideration when deriving the final grades. Experimental results on real MOOC peer grading datasets show that the proposed models outperform baselines and the relation of true grades among submissions indeed contributes to the improvement in the grade estimation. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Malekian2019354,"This work aims to characterize students' writing processes using keystroke logs and understand how the extracted characteristics influence the text quality at specific moments of writing. Earlier works have proposed predictive models characterizing students' writing processes and mainly rely on distribution-based measures of pauses obtained from the overall keystroke logs. However, the effect of isolated phases of writing has not been evaluated in these models. Moreover, current theories on writing suggest that the quality of writing depends on when specific writing behaviours are performed. This view is not examined in the keystroke logging analysis literature. Addressing the mentioned challenges, the two contributions of this work are: a) characterizing students' writing processes connected to isolated writing phases and examining their influence on writing quality; and b) temporal analysis of keystrokes and investigating whether the significance of writing characteristics varies as students progress in their writing task. Our results suggest that characterizing students' writing based on isolated writing phases is slightly more predictive of writing quality. Additionally, the effect of several writing characteristics on writing quality changes when considering the time dimension. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Howlin2019742,"Clustering of educational data allows similar students to be grouped, in either crisp or fuzzy sets, based on their similarities. Standard approaches are well suited to identifying common student behaviors; however, by design, they put much less emphasis on less common behaviors or outliers. The approach presented in this paper employs fuzzing clustering in the identification of these outlier behaviors. The algorithm is an iterative one, where clustering is applied, outliers identified, the data restricted to the outliers, and the process repeated. This approach produces a clustering that is crisp between each iteration and fuzzy within. It arose as a consequence of trying to cluster student progress trajectories in an adaptive learning platform.

We train a Siamese neural network to compute the similarity between two texts. Using this similarity measure, a student's recent essays are compared to their first essays, and a writing style development profile is constructed. We cluster these student profiles and analyze the resulting clusters. We evaluate clusters with respect to writing style quality indicators, and identify optimal clusters, showing significant improvement in writing style, while also observing suboptimal clusters, exhibiting periods of limited development and even setbacks. Furthermore, we identify general development trends between students, showing that as students progress through high school, their writing styles deviate, leaving students less similar when they finish high school, than when they start. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Jayaraman2019584,"Student retention is a major challenge at American universities with the average six year graduation rate hovering around 59%. Among minority students the graduation rate drops to 46% for Blacks and 55% for Hispanics. Low graduation rates not only impact the financial well-being of individuals but the economy as a whole. Thus, improving student retention, in particular, minority student retention, is of paramount importance at institutions of higher education. This paper describes a machine learning approach to predicting minority native and transfer student dropout using a dataset from a four year Hispanic serving institution in the north eastern region of the United States with a large percentage of minority students. The results of the study show that standard machine learning models can predict minority transfer student dropout with a high degree of accuracy of 97% and minority native student dropout with an accuracy of 81%. The features that were most important in predicting minority transfer student dropout were SAT scores, and college cumulative GPA, while high school GPA and college cumulative GPA were the top predictors for minority native student dropout. This study demonstrates that educational institutions can use cost effective off-the-shelf standard machine learning models to achieve a high degree of accuracy in predicting minority student dropout. The high prediction accuracy achieved helps in reliably identifying at-risk minority students and providing them with necessary interventions to support their academic success. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Dang2019276,"A student's ability to regulate their thoughts, emotions and behaviors in the face of temptation is linked to their task specific motivational goals and dispositions. Behavioral tasks are designed to strain a targeted resource to differentiate individuals through measures of their performance. In this paper, we explore how student behavior on differentially gamed learning material relates to estimates of student motivational goals and dispositions. We leverage observations of students in two different courses using an intelligent tutoring system over an entire academic year. We use a previously validated heuristic model of gaming detection to label instances of gaming. Each student's tendency to game is estimated separately using highly gamed and non-highly gamed sections of the course. Each estimate of student gaming is compared to pre-course self-reported measures of student motivations. Results indicate that in naturalistic settings, gaming on more challenging materials is less influenced by student motivations and potentially a result of adaptive learning behaviors. Similarly, student gaming estimates using only non-highly gamed material are significantly related to all targeted motivation measures. Implications and future directions are discussed. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Zhi2019218,"Viewing worked examples before problem solving has been shown to improve learning efficiency in novice programming. Example-based feedback seeks to present smaller, adaptive worked example steps during problem solving. We present a method for automatically generating and selecting adaptive, example-based programming feedback using historical student data. Our data-driven feature-based (DDF) example generation method automatically learns program features from data and selects example pairs based on when students complete each feature. We performed an experiment to compare three example generation methods: Student trace data, Data-Driven Features (DDF), and Expert examples. Two experts rated the quality of feedback for each generator, and they rated both the Expert and DDF example feedback as significantly more relevant to students' goals than the Student example feedback. However, there were no significant differences between the DDF and Expert examples. We compared these approaches to one that combined DDF with an Interactive Selection step (DDF-IS), where the user (in this case, an expert) selects their preferred data-driven feature before an example is selected. DDF-IS produced significantly more relevant examples than all other approaches, with significantly higher overall example quality than DDF. This suggests that our DDF approach allows more relevant examples to be selected than existing approaches, and that we may be able to leverage interactivity with the student to further improve example quality. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Flemming2019548,"Efficient learning experiences require content to dynamically match a learner's skill; this assumes a fast and accurate assessment of the learner's skill and the ability to update content accordingly. Effective personalized learning therefore involves deriving a performance-predictive mapping between behavioral and environmental factors. Once learned, this relationship can be used to generate new content and to update skill estimates based on the learner's interactions in an adaptive system. To provide proof of concept: (1) We develop a fast-paced driving video game where the player skillfully navigates a cluttered environment comprising obstacles and collectibles. Game content is generated procedurally and player behavior is recorded in the game-this provides an ideal test-bed for a method aiming to learn such a performance-predictive mapping. (2) Using blurred occupancy maps of the game's segments, we generate risk-weighted trajectory profiles for each user and segment of the game. Here, we show that these profiles can be used in a regression model to predict in-game performance both within and between game segments. Additionally, these profiles themselves reveal a trade-off between in-game rewards and risks. Successful identification of predictive environmental units within the game provides insight into the mapping between environmental features and performance, while facilitating the process of procedurally generating new, appropriate content in our adaptive system. We show that rapidly assessed measures of risk are highly predictive of both driving performance and reward rate, providing proof-of-concept evidence for the feasibility of a personalized adaptive learning system for this game. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

In this paper, we present a new method to automatically evaluate the collaboration level of students in groups using computer vision techniques. Instead of single-time solicitation techniques such as self-reported questionnaires to evaluate the collaboration, we evaluate the entire process of the collaboration by analyzing image data captured from groups. We use object detection techniques such as Mask R-CNN method to process our data. This process is based on detecting people and other objects from pictures and video clips of the collaborative learning process, then evaluating the performance of students in the interactive learning and textbook settings using these collaborative indicators.

conference,Dong2019540,"Liberal arts universities possess a vast catalog of courses from which students can choose. The common approach to surfacing these courses has been through traditional key word matching information retrieval. The course catalog description used to match on may, however, be overly brief and omit important topics covered in the course. Furthermore, even if the description is verbose, novice students may use search terms that do not match relevant courses, due to their catalog descriptions being written in the specialized language of a discipline outside of their own. In this work, we design and user test an approach intended to help mitigate these issues by augmenting course catalog descriptions with topic keywords inferred to be relevant to the course by analyzing the information conveyed by student co-enrollment networks. We tune a neural course embedding model based on enrollment sequences, then regress the embedding to a bag-of-words representation of course descriptions. Using this technique, we are able to predict potentially relevant words that are not in a course's description and surface these words through a real-world recommendation platform. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Nazaretsky2019129,"Sequencing items in adaptive learning systems typically relies on a large pool of interactive question items that are analyzed into a hierarchy of skills, also known as Knowledge Components (KCs). Educational data mining techniques can be used to analyze students response data in order to optimize the mapping of items to KCs, with similarity-based clustering as one of the two main approaches for this type of analysis. However, current similarity-based methods make the implicit assumption that students' performance on items that belong to the same KC should be similar. This assumption holds if the latent trait (mastery of the underlying skill) is relatively fixed during students' activity, as in the context of testing, which is the primary context in which these methods were developed and applied. However, in adaptive learning systems that aim for learning, and address subject matters such as K-6 Math that consist of multiple sub-skills, this assumption does not hold. In this paper we propose a new item-similarity measure, termed Kappa Learning (KL), which aims to address this gap. KL identifies similarity between items under the assumption of learning, namely, that learners' mastery of the underlying skills changes as they progress through the items. We evaluate KL on data from a K-6 Math Intelligent Tutoring System, with experts' tagging as ground truth, and on simulated data. Our results show that clustering that is based on KL outperforms clustering that is based on commonly used similarity measures (Cohen's Kappa, Yule, and Pearson), and that KL is also superior in the task of discovering the number of KCs. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Reddick2019754,"One significant challenge in the field of measuring ability is measuring the current ability of a learner while they are learning. Many forms of inference become computationally complex in the presence of time-dependent learner ability, and are not feasible to implement in an online context. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach which can estimate learner skill over time even in the presence of large data sets. We use a rating system derived from the Elo rating system and its relatives, which are commonly used in chess and sports tournaments. A learner's submission of a course assignment is interpreted as a single match. We apply this approach to Coursera's online learning platform, which includes millions of learners who have submitted assignments tens of millions of times in over 3000 courses. We demonstrate that this provides reliable estimates of item difficulty and learner ability. Finally, we address how this scoring framework may be used as a basis for various applications that account for a learner's ability, such as adaptive diagnostic tests and personalized recommendations. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Boumi2019264,"Simplified categorizations have often led to college students being labeled as full-time or part-time students. However, at many universities student enrollment patterns can be much more complicated, as it is not uncommon for students to alternate between full-time and part-time enrollment each semester based on finances, scheduling, or family needs. While prior research has established that fulltime students maintain better outcomes than their part-time counterparts, little study has examined the impact of mixed enrollment patterns on academic outcomes. In this paper, we apply a Hidden Markov Model to identify students' enrollment strategies according to three different categories: part-time, full-time, and mixed enrollment. According to the enrollment classification we investigate and compare the academic performance outcomes of each group. Analysis of data collected from the University of Central Florida from 2008 to 2017 indicates that mixed enrollment students are closer in performance to full-time students, than parttime students. More importantly, during their part-time semesters, mixed-enrollment students significantly outperform part-time students. Such a finding suggests that increased engagement through the occasional full-time enrollment leads to better overall outcomes. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Sher2019706,"Mobile technology has been a focus of research since the early 2000s and has attracted researchers from various disciplines ranging from pedagogical, health-care, technological to app developers. In recent times, there has been a substantial interest in capitalizing on the abundance and the ubiquity of these technologies for their educational use. However, the role of mobile phones in educational setting is still largely under-researched. Similarly, little attention has been paid to the research on the extension of learning analytics to analyze the learning processes and strategies of students adopting mobile platforms. Traditionally, the research into mobile learning has mainly relied upon self-reported data. While literature has evidence that survey data facilitates extraction of invaluable information, it suffers from a significant shortcoming - unreliability due to learner bias and poor recall. Therefore, this paper outlines the doctoral research project that explores the use of mobile technology in educational context using data mining techniques and learning analytics methods to analyze digital trace data and provide insights into how students learn. The results so far have enabled us to categorize students as adopting one of the three technological modality strategies - strategic, minimalist, and intensive - based on how extensive the use of multiple modalities (such as desktops, tablets, smartphones) is for learning activities and their final academic performance. Our results also provide evidence suggesting incorporation of the modality used by the learner, for carrying out an activity, as a viable feature in learner models helps in improving the prediction power of these models. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Reilly2019643,"Rich streams of fine-grained activity data are generated by many game-based learning environments. These data can be mined unobtrusively to assess student learning and potentially foster tailored feedback and scaffolding. Stealth assessment frameworks are more commonly seen in constrained virtual environments with clear goals and markers of progress; these diagnostic/formative-feedback strategies are more difficult to implement in open-ended environments with a larger range of potential activities and more variation in problem-solving strategies. This study investigates the potential for using a long short-term memory network (LSTM)-based model to enable stealth assessment in an immersive virtual world for learning. We investigate how well these temporally-sensitive models can predict learning gains on a pre-post survey, as well as predicting the quality of a student-generated concept map. This method is applied to log file data from a middle school science curriculum based on an open-ended immersive virtual environment.

conference,Taniguchi2019655,"This study investigates how we can understand students' actual status in C programming exercises from their learning activity logs. In a face-to-face course of C programming exercise, it is hard for a teacher to see who are in trouble from their apperance. It is not always true that typing something means he or she is making some progress. Therefore it is important to identify, or possibly even predict, students having difficulty from their activity patterns. Most of the prior work paid attention to only trial-and-error activities, such as compile results and execution errors. However, it tends to be overlooked that knowledge acquisition process is also worthy of attention. When a student encounters a compile error, they usually read textbooks to seek a solution. It is considered to be useful for the task whether he or she has an ability to find appropriate pages for error resolution. In this paper, we propose a method to predict whether a student can resolve errors or not. Based on students' activity logs collected from our programming environment and e-book system, we conduct experiments to show and discuss the prediction performance. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Zingle2019474,"Peer assessment has proven to be a useful strategy for increasing the timeliness and quantity of formative feedback, as well as for promoting metacognitive thinking among students. Previous research has determined that reviews that contain suggestions can motivate students to revise and improve their work. This paper describes a method for automatically detecting suggestions in review text. The quantity of suggestions can be treated as a metric for the helpfulness of review text. Even before a review is submitted, the system can tell a reviewer when a review is lacking in suggestions and consequently advise that they be added. This paper presents several neural-network approaches for detecting suggestions and compares them against traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods such as rule-based techniques, as well as past machine-learning approaches. Our network-based classifiers outperformed rule-based classifiers in every experiment. Our neural-network classifiers attained F1-scores in the low 90% range, outperforming the support vector machine (SVM) classifier whose F1-score was 88%. The naïve Bayes (NB) classifier had an F1-score of 84% and the rule-based classifier had an F1-score of 80%. As in other domains such as determining sentiment, we found that neural-network models perform better than the likes of naïve Bayes and support vector machines when classifying suggestions in text. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Mussack2019615,"Automated learning systems allow educators to scale up their efficacy, while personalized systems retain the ability to customize to the individual student. A core issue in developing such adaptive learning systems is to understand how different items (e.g., math exercises) relate to one another, and to exploit this understanding to predict performance on an item. Data-driven approaches aim to discover latent concepts through embeddings that predict similarity between items, typically using only performance data or item data, but not both. While these embeddings are meant to uncover latent concepts (e.g., associativity in mathematics or chemistry), they are better construed as representing topics that reflect the similarity structure in performance or item features. One major difficulty is that embedded concepts may differ only in presentation and not in substance. For example, when learning about numbers, young children struggle with different representational formats (e.g., finger counts, Hindu-Arabic numeral) despite the underlying concept being the same (e.g., ""3""). By incorporating item information that allows structured similarity comparison between an item's content and representational format, we can begin to parse out what aspects lead to behavioral differences. Here we develop a deep learning framework for learning concept embeddings that integrates behavioral and item-features to better factorize embeddings into content and presentation. This allows us to fully represent the complexity of the items space, while still extracting scientifically-useful results from the analysis. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Pandey2019384,"Knowledge tracing is the task of modeling each student's mastery of knowledge concepts (KCs) as (s)he engages with a sequence of learning activities. Each student's knowledge is modeled by estimating the performance of the student on the learning activities. It is an important research area for providing a personalized learning platform to students. In recent years, methods based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) outperformed all the traditional methods because of their ability to capture a complex representation of human learning. However, these methods face the issue of not generalizing well while dealing with sparse data which is the case with real-world data as students interact with few KCs. In order to address this issue, we develop an approach that identifies the KCs from the student's past activities that are relevant to the given KC and predicts his/her mastery based on the relatively few KCs that it picked. Since predictions are made based on relatively few past activities, it handles the data sparsity problem better than the methods based on RNN. For identifying the relevance between the KCs, we propose a self-attention based approach, Self Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). Extensive experimentation on a variety of real-world dataset shows that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models for knowledge tracing, improving AUC by 4.43% on average. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Bahargam2019504,"A long line of literature has focused on the problem of selecting a team of individuals from a large pool of candidates, such that certain constraints are respected, and a given objective function is maximized. In this work, we extend the team formation literature by introducing the Guided Team-Partitioning (GTP) problem, which asks for the partitioning of a population into teams such that the centroid of each team is as close as possible to a given target vector. This formulation allows the team-builder to control the composition of the produced teams and has natural applications in practical settings. Algorithms for the GTP need to simultaneously consider the composition of multiple non-overlapping teams that compete for the same population of candidates. This makes the problem considerably more challenging than formulations that focus on the optimization of a single team. In fact, we prove that GTP is NP-hard to solve and even to approximate. The complexity of the problem motivates us to consider efficient algorithmic heuristics, which we evaluate via experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Sher2019651,"The research area of analyzing log file trace data to build academic performance prediction models has tremendous potential for pedagogical support. Currently, these learner models are developed from logs that are composed of one intermixed stream of data, treated in the same manner regardless of which platform (mobile, desktops) the data came from. In this paper, we designed a correlational study using log data from two offerings of a blended course to investigate the effects of the variables, derived from the use of varying platforms, on the prediction of students' academic success. Given that learners use a combination of devices when engaging in learning activities, it is apparent that weighing the logs based on the platform they originate from might generate different (possibly better) models, with varying priority assigned to different model features. For instance, our results show that the overall frequency of course material access is a less powerful indicator of academic performance compared to the frequency of course material access 'from mobile devices', probably due to the benefits associated with ubiquitous any-time access available to mobile learners. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to bring to light the potential for improvement of prediction power of models after considering the learner's platform of access, within the learning analytics community and the fields of user modeling and recommender systems, in general. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Toda2019438,"Gamification frameworks can aid in gamification planning for education. Most frameworks, however, do not provide ways to select, relate or recommend how to use game elements, to gamify a certain educational task. Instead, most provide a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach covering all learners, without considering different user characteristics, such as gender. Therefore, this work aims to adopt a data-driven approach to provide a set of game element recommendations, based on user preferences, that could be used by teachers and instructors to gamify learning activities. We analysed data from a novel survey of 733 people (male=569 and female=164), collecting information about user preferences regarding game elements. Our results suggest that the most important rules were based on four (out of nineteen) types of game elements: Objectives, Levels, Progress and Choice. From the perspective of user gender, for the female sample, the most interesting rule associated Objectives with Progress, Badges and Information (confidence=0.97), whilst the most interesting rule for the male sample associated also Objectives with Progress, Renovation and Choice (confidence=0.94). These rules and our descriptive analysis provides recommendations on how game elements can be used in educational scenarios. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,ElizabethOwen2019378,"Games in service of learning are uniquely positioned to offer immersive, interactive educational experiences. Well-designed games build challenge through a series of well-ordered problems or activities, in which perseverance is key for working through ingame failure and increasing game difficulty. Indeed, persistence through challenges during learning is beneficial not just in games but in other contexts as well, with grit and perseverance positively associated with academic performance and learning outcomes. However, recent studies suggest that not all persistence is positive, suggesting that many students end up ""wheel-spinning"", spending considerable time on a topic without achieving mastery. Thus, it is vital to differentiate productive and unproductive persistence in order to understand emergent student progress, particularly in the context of learning games and personalized learning systems, in which individual pathways differ greatly based on student needs. Leveraging Educational Data Mining methods, this study builds a detector of wheel-spinning behavior (differentiated from productive persistence) in an adaptive, game-based learning system. With the ability to predict unproductive persistence early, this detection model can be used to intelligently adapt to students needing further support in-system, as well as informing in-person intervention in a classroom setting-thus supporting a personalized, engaging learning experience in both formal and informal learning environments. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Zhang2019691,"Cognitive diagnosis aims to analyze the status of knowledge mastery of student and is thus very important for personalized education. The existing methods mostly depend on the empirical Q-matrix from domain experts. However, the knowledge points in Q-matrix are unavoidably overlapping, leading to the weak performance on the practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel model for student knowledge diagnosis, called Sparse Factor Learning (SFL). SFL learns a meta-knowledge dictionary from student response data of test questions, where the knowledge structure of any entity (e.g., student, question or others) is a sparse linear combination of dictionary atoms. Our method has three innovations for cognitive diagnosis: learning latent nonoverlapping meta-knowledge, sparely representing the entities, and removing the bias noise for guessing and slipping. To verify our method, we collected the response data from the final exam of C language program of international class and then conducted the experiments for knowledge diagnosis, student grouping and response prediction. The experiment results show that SFL works effectively and results in decent performance. Besides, it delivers that student who favors mathematics and physics can achieve higher score.

conference,Harrak2019312,"Students' questions categorization is a challenging task as the available corpora are often limited in size (particularly with languages other than English) and require a costly preliminary manual annotation to train the classifiers. Ensemble learning can help improve machine learning results by combining several models, and is particularly efficient to leverage the strengths of very different classifiers. In this paper, we investigate how combining a rule-based annota-tor (based on keywords identified by an expert) with various machine learning-based approaches and TF-IDF can improve the automated identification of questions asked by 1st year medicine students on an online platform, according to a coding scheme using 4 dimensions. First we evaluated the performance of several models, calculating the kappa between the prediction and the manually labelled dataset, according to each dimension. Then, using a stacking approach, we tried different combinations of them to design a predictive model with a higher performance. The results reveal that the new ensemble models can help to increase the performance for all dimensions of the dataset, in particular those for which the expert rule-based system showed the lowest performance.

conference,Ding2019282,"Knowledge tracing allows Intelligent Tutoring Systems to infer which topics or skills a student has mastered, thus adjusting curriculum accordingly. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for knowledge tracing and has achieved significant improvements compared with models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factor Analysis (PFA). However, DKT is not as interpretable as other models because the decision-making process learned by recurrent neural networks is not wholly understood by the research community. In this paper, we critically examine the DKT model, visualizing and analyzing the behaviors of DKT in high dimensional space. We modify and explore the DKT model and discover that Deep Knowledge Tracing has some critical pitfalls: 1). instead of tracking each skill through time, DKT is more likely to learn an 'ability' model; 2) the recurrent nature of DKT reinforces irrelevant information that it uses during the tracking task; 3) an untrained recurrent network can achieve similar results to a trained DKT model, supporting a conclusion that recurrence relations are not properly learned and, instead, improvements are simply a benefit of projection into a high dimensional, sparse vector space. Based on these observations, we propose improvements and future directions for conducting knowledge tracing research using deep models. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Nguyen2019139,"Knowledge components (KCs) define the underlying skill model of intelligent educational software, and they are critical to understanding and improving the efficacy of learning technology. In this research, we show how learning curve analysis is used to fit a KC model - one that was created after use of the learning technology - which can then be improved by human-centered data science methods. We analyzed data from 417 middle-school students who used a digital learning game to learn decimal numbers and decimal operations. Our initial results showed that problem types (e.g., ordering decimals, adding decimals) capture students' performance better than underlying decimal misconceptions (e.g., longer decimals are larger). Through a process of KC model refinement and domain knowledge interpretation, we were able to identify the difficulties that students faced in learning decimals. Based on this result, we present an instructional redesign proposal for our digital learning game and outline a framework for post-hoc KC modeling in a tutoring system. More generally, the method we used in this work can help guide changes to the type, content and order of problems in educational software. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Emerson201939,"Recent years have seen a growing interest in block-based programming environments for computer science education. While these environments hold significant potential for novice programmers, they lack the adaptive support necessary to accommodate students exhibiting a wide range of initial capabilities and dispositions toward computing. A promising approach to addressing this problem is introducing adaptive feedback. This work investigates a key capability for adaptive support: training student models that predict student success in block-based programming activities for novice programmers. The predictive student models utilize four categories of features: prior performance, hint usage, activity progress, and interface interaction. In addition to evaluating the accuracy of these models for multiple block-based programming activities, we also investigate how quickly the models converge to accurate prediction, and we evaluate the additive value of each of the four categories of features. Results show that the predictive models are able to predict whether a student will successfully complete an exercise with high accuracy, as well as converge on this prediction early in the sequence of student interactions. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Mao2019119,"Early prediction of student difficulty during long-duration learning activities allows a tutoring system to intervene by providing needed support, such as a hint, or by alerting an instructor. To be effective, these predictions must come early and be highly accurate, but such predictions are difficult for open-ended programming problems. In this work, Recent Temporal Patterns (RTPs) are used in conjunction with Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression to build robust yet interpretable models for early predictions. We performed two tasks: to predict student success and difficulty during one, open-ended novice programming task of drawing a square-shaped spiral. We compared RTP against several machine learning models ranging from the classic to the more recent deep learning models such as Long Short Term Memory to predict whether students would be able to complete the programming task. Our results show that RTP-based models outperformed all others, and could successfully classify students after just one minute of a 20-minute exercise (students can spend more than 1 hour on it). To determine when a system might intervene to prevent incompleteness or eventual dropout, we applied RTP at regular intervals to predict whether a student would make progress within the next five minutes, reflecting that they may be having difficulty. RTP successfully classified these students needing interventions over 85% of the time, with increased accuracy using data-driven program features. These results contribute significantly to the potential to build a fully data-driven tutoring system for novice programming. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Tato2019623,"In this paper we propose a hybrid architecture combining Deep Neural Network architectures with expert's knowledge to automatically evaluate socio-moral reasoning maturity. Socio-moral reasoning represents a key ability to sustain efficient adaptive social interactions. In the proposed solutions, expert knowledge is first computed using NLP and information retrieval techniques and then added to the DNN architecture using the attentional mechanism. It uses pre-annotated textual data and a coding scheme (SoMoral) applied by experts in psychology. State-of-the-art text classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, etc.) achieved very low results in our context in contrast to LSTM and CNN (when combined with expert knowledge). Our solutions were compared to four models: a CNN-only model, an LSTM-only model, a CNN and an LSTM models where the expert knowledge is concatenated directly with the data (instead of using attention). Experiments show that our models can accurately predict the level of socio-moral reasoning skills. Our findings suggest the need for hybrid neural networks that integrate prior expert knowledge (especially when it is necessary to compensate the strong dependency - of deep learning methods - on data size or the possible unbalanced datasets). © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Choffin201929,"Spaced repetition is among the most studied learning strategies in the cognitive science literature. It consists in temporally distributing exposure to an information so as to improve long-term memorization. Providing students with an adaptive and personalized distributed practice schedule would benefit more than just a generic scheduler. However, the applicability of such adaptive schedulers seems to be limited to pure memorization, e.g. flashcards or foreign language learning. In this article, we first frame the research problem of optimizing an adaptive and personalized spaced repetition scheduler when memorization concerns the application of underlying multiple skills. To this end, we choose to rely on a student model for inferring knowledge state and memory dynamics on any skill or combination of skills. We argue that no knowledge tracing model takes both memory decay and multiple skill tagging into account for predicting student performance. As a consequence, we propose a new student learning and forgetting model suited to our research problem: DAS3H builds on the additive factor models and includes a representation of the temporal distribution of past practice on the skills involved by an item. In particular, DAS3H allows the learning and forgetting curves to differ from one skill to another. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on three real-world educational datasets that DAS3H outperforms other state-of-the-art EDM models. These results suggest that incorporating both item-skill relationships and forgetting effect improves over student models that consider one or the other. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Abdi2019228,"The Elo rating system has been recognised as an effective method for modelling students and items within adaptive educational systems. The existing Elo-based models have the limiting assumption that items are only tagged with a single concept and are mainly studied in the context of adaptive testing systems. In this paper, we introduce a multivari-ate Elo-based learner model that is suitable for the domains where learning items can be tagged with multiple concepts, and investigate its fit in the context of adaptive learning. To evaluate the model, we first compare the predictive performance of the proposed model against the standard Elo-based model using synthetic and public data sets. Our results from this study indicate that our proposed model has superior predictive performance compared to the standard Elo-based model, but the difference is rather small. We then investigate the fit of the proposed multivariate Elo-based model by integrating it into an adaptive learning system which incorporates the principles of open learner models (OLMs). The results from this study suggest that the availability of additional parameters derived from multivariate Elo-based models have two further advantages: guiding adaptive behaviour for the system and providing additional insight for students and instructors. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Whitehill2019462,"We explored1 how learners' subjective ratings of open educational resources (OERs) in terms of how much they find them ""helpful"" can predict the actual learning gains associated with those resources as measured with pre- and post-tests. To this end, we developed a probabilistic model called GRAM (Gaussian Rating Aggregation Model) that combines subjective ratings from multiple learners into an aggregate quality score of each resource. Based on an experiment we conducted on Mechanical Turk (n = 304 participants with m = 17 math tutorial videos as resources), we found that aggregated subjective ratings are highly (and stat. sig.) predictive of the resources' average learning gains, with Pearson correlation of 0.78. Moreover, when predicting average learning gains of new learners, subjective scores were still predictive (Pearson correlation of 0.49) and attained higher prediction accuracy than a model that directly uses pre- and post-test data to estimate learning gains for each resource. These results have potential implications for large-scale learning platforms (e.g., MOOCs, Khan Academy) that assign resources (tutorials, explanations, hints, etc.) to learners based on the expected learning gains. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

conference,Ren2019158,"Over the past decade, low graduation and retention rates have plagued higher education institutions. To help students graduate on time and achieve optimal learning outcomes, many institutions provide advising services supported by educational technologies. Accurate grade prediction is an integral part of these services such as degree planning software, personalized advising systems and early warning systems that can identify students at-risk of dropping from their field of study. In this work, we present next-term grade prediction models based on students' cumulative knowledge and co-taken courses. The proposed models are based on a matrix factorization framework and incorporate a co-taken course interaction function to learn the influence from the co-taken courses on the target course. The co-taken course interaction function is formed by a neural network, which takes the knowledge difference between the co-taken courses and the target course as input, and outputs an influence value that will be used to predict students' grades on the target course. The experimental results on various datasets from a U.S. University demonstrate that the proposed models significantly outperform competitive baselines across different test sets. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed models' performance with different numbers of co-taken courses as well as different numbers of co-taken course subjects, and highlight with an application case study how a student might make decisions related to selection of courses.

conference,Gitinabard2018,"The high level of attrition and low rate of certification in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has prompted a great deal of research. Prior researchers have focused on predicting dropout based upon behavioral features such as student confusion, click-stream patterns, and social interactions. However, few studies have focused on combining student logs with forum data. In this work, we use data from two different offerings of the same MOOC. We conduct a survival analysis to identify likely dropouts. We then examine two classes of features, social and behavioral, and apply a combination of modeling and feature-selection methods to identify the most relevant features to predict both dropout and certification. We examine the utility of three different model types and we consider the impact of different definitions of dropout on the predictors. Finally we assess the reliability of the models over time by evaluating whether or not models from week 1 can predict dropout in week 2, and so on. The outcomes of this study will help instructors identify students likely to fail or dropout as soon as the first two weeks and provide them with more support. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Student models, if successful, would help determine strong predictors of student success, which would highlight potential causal factors for such success, allowing schools to focus on refinements and interventions that positively impact their student outcomes. In this research, TutorGen has partnered with Western Governors University (WGU), a large online university, and gathered data at scale in order to build exploratory models to predict student outcomes.

conference,Chen2018,"Adaptive online courses are designed to automatically customize material for different users, typically based on data captured during the course. Assessing the quality of these adaptive courses, however, can be difficult. Traditional assessment methods for (machine) learning algorithms, such as comparison against a ground truth, are often unavailable due to education’s unique goal of affecting both internal user knowledge, which cannot be directly measured, as well as external, measurable performance. Traditional metrics for education like quiz scores, on the other hand, do not necessarily capture the adaptive course’s ability to present the right material to different users. In this work, we present a mathematical framework for developing scalable, efficiently computable metrics for these courses that can be used by instructors to gauge the efficacy of the adaptation and their course content. Our metric framework takes as input a set of quantities describing user activities in the course, and balances definitions of user consistency and overall efficacy as inferred by the quantity distributions. We support the metric definitions by comparing the results of a comprehensive statistical analysis with a sample metric evaluation on a dataset of roughly 5,000 users from an online chess platform. In doing so, we find that our metrics yield important insights about the course that are embedded in the larger statistical analysis, as well as additional insights into student drop-off rates. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Botelho2018,"Student affect has been found to correlate with short- and long-term learning outcomes, including college attendance as well as interest and involvement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. However, there still remain significant questions about the processes by which affect shifts and develops during the learning process. Much of this research can be split into affect dynamics, the study of the temporal transitions between affective states, and affective chronometry, the study of how an affect state emerges and dissipates over time. Thus far, these affective processes have been primarily studied using field observations, sensors, or student self-report measures; however, these approaches can be coarse, and obtaining finer-grained data produces challenges to data fidelity. Recent developments in sensor-free detectors of student affect, utilizing only the data from student interactions with a computer-based learning platform, open an opportunity to study affect dynamics and chronometry at moment-to-moment levels of granularity. This work presents a novel approach, applying sensor-free detectors to study these two prominent problems in affective research. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Eagle2018,"In this work we use prior to tutor-session data to generate an individualized student knowledge model. Intelligent learning environments use student models to individualize curriculum sequencing and help messages. Researchers decompose the learning tasks into sets of Knowledge Components (KCs) that represent individual units of knowledge; the student model estimates a parameters for each KC, but not for each student. Using existing performance data to adjust parameters for each individual student improves model fit, and leads to different practice recommendations. However, in order to be implemented in a live system we need to have a method to estimate the student parameters using only the student‘s prior activities. In this work, we use data collected from student reading, prior tutor lessons, to predict individualized difference weights for parameters of a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) variant. We find that best-fitting student parameters trained on previous lessons do not directly transfer to new lessons; however, we can effectively predict the student parameters for the new lesson by using features derived from prior lessons, and prior to tutor text-reading transaction data. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Agarwal2018,"One of the key benefits that Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) offers compared to many competing student modelling paradigms is that its parameters are meaningful and interpretable. These parameters have been used to answer basic research questions and identify content in need of iterative improvement (due to, for instance, low learning or high slip rates). However, a core challenge to the interpretation of BKT parameters is that several combinations of BKT parameters can often fit the same data comparably well. Even if, as some have argued, BKT is not truly non-identifiable, in practice highly different parameters with comparable goodness are often found using modern BKT fitting packages. These parameter sets can have highly divergent values for guess and slip. Several approaches have been proposed but none of those have yet led to fully stable and trustworthy parameter estimates. In this work, we propose a new iterative method based on contextual guess and slip estimation that converges to stable estimates for skill-level guess and slip parameters. This method alternates between calculating contextual estimates of guess and slip and estimating skill-level parameters, iterating until convergence. Thus, it produces a more stable set of parameters that can be more confidently used in analyzing content efficacy. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Rajendran2018,"Researchers have highlighted how tracking learners’ eye-gaze can reveal their reading behaviors and strategies, and this provides a framework for developing personalized feedback to improve learning and problem solving skills. In this paper, we describe analyses of eye-gaze data collected from 16 middle school students who worked with Betty’s Brain, an open-ended learning environment, where students learn science by building causal models to teach a virtual agent. Our goal was to test whether newly available consumer-level eye trackers could provide the data that would allow us to probe further into the relations between students’ reading of hypertext resources and building of graphical causal maps. We collected substantial amounts of gaze data and then constructed classifier models to predict whether students would be successful in constructing correct causal links. These models predicted correct map-building actions with an accuracy of 80% (F1 = 0.82; Cohen’s kappa κ = 0.62). The proportions of correct link additions are in turn directly related to learners’ performance in Betty's Brain. Therefore, students’ gaze patterns when reading the resources may be good indicators of their overall performance. These findings can be used to support the development of a real-time eye gaze analysis system, which can detect students reading patterns, and when necessary provide support to help them become better readers. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Matayoshi2018,"In the context of an adaptive learning and assessment system, ALEKS, we examine aspects of forgetting and aspects of a ‘testing effect’ (in which the act of simply being presented a problem in an assessment seems to assist in the learning process). Using a dataset consisting of over six million ALEKS assessments, we first look at the trend of student responses over the course of the assessment, finding little evidence for such a testing effect. We then refine our approach by looking at cases in which a question is repeated in an assessment; repeats are possible because some question is always chosen at random in an assessment for data-collection purposes. We find evidence of a testing effect for higher-performing students; for lower-performing students, we find a decreased willingness to attempt an answer the second time a problem is presented. Then, turning to forgetting, we find that the content representing the “high points” of a student’s learning sees a more precipitous drop in the student’s memory than does other content (perhaps because the “high point” skills and concepts may not have been practiced or developed much since the original learning event).

conference,Sen2018,"In STEM domains, students are expected to acquire domain knowledge from visual representations that they may not yet be able to interpret. Such learning requires perceptual fluency: the ability to intuitively and rapidly see which concepts visuals show and to translate among multiple visuals. Instructional problems that engage students in nonverbal, implicit learning processes enhance perceptual fluency. Such processes are highly influenced by sequence effects. Thus far, we lack a principled approach for identifying a sequence of perceptual-fluency problems that promote robust learning. Here, we describe a novel educational data mining approach that uses machine learning to generate an optimal sequence of visuals for perceptual-fluency problems. In a human experiment, we show that a machine-generated sequence outperforms both a random sequence and a sequence generated by a human domain expert. Interestingly, the machine-generated sequence resulted in significantly lower accuracy during training, but higher posttest accuracy. This suggests that the machine-generated sequence induced desirable difficulties. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that an educational data mining approach can induce desirable difficulties for perceptual learning. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

We then test how much these network-based features can increase the performance of a model with only conventional features (e.g., demographics, high school GPA, standardized test scores, etc.). We labeled students as “above median” and “below median” students based on their first term GPA. Several machine learning models were then applied, ranging from logistic regression, SVM, and random forests, to AdaBoost.

conference,Koedinger2018,"The “doer effect” is the assertion that the amount of interactive practice activity a student engages in is much more predictive of learning than the amount of passive reading or watching video the same student engages in. Although the evidence for a doer effect is now substantial [6, 7, 12], the evidence for a causal doer effect is not as well developed. To address this, we mined data for evidence of a causal doer effect across multiple domains. We examined data from two online courses in Psychology, one in Biology, one in Statistics, and two in Information Science, applying causal discovery algorithms [14] in Tetrad to each. Assuming that factors driving a student’s choices regarding how to spend their time in an online course are temporally prior to their performance on quizzes and exams, we found evidence of a causal relationship in every domain we studied. We did not find evidence that a unique causal model held in every domain we studied, but when we estimated the size of the causal relationships in the models we found in each domain, we did find evidence in every case that doing has a much stronger quantitative effect on learning than either reading or watching video. This work may be the first EDM effort to explore the generalizability of a causal claim about learning across multiple datasets from a variety of courses and contexts of use. It makes vivid the role of causal data mining algorithms in educational research. The evidence presented furthers the case for doer effect causality, but also recommends a need for richer data with more student background and learning process variables to better isolate causal directionality without assumptions about temporal order and unmeasured confounds. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,ALSaad2018,"This paper addresses the question of identifying a concept dependency graph for a MOOC through unsupervised analysis of lecture transcripts. The problem is important: extracting a concept graph is the first step in helping students with varying preparation to understand course material. The problem is challenging: instructors are unaware of the student preparation diversity and may be unable to identify the right resolution of the concepts, necessitating costly updates; inferring concepts from groups suffers from polysemy; the temporal order of concepts depends on the concepts in question. We propose innovative unsupervised methods to discover a directed concept dependency within and between lectures. Our main technical innovation lies in exploiting the temporal ordering amongst concepts to discover the graph. We propose two measures—the Bridge Ensemble Measure and the Global Direction Measure—to infer the existence and the direction of the dependency relations between concepts. The bridge ensemble measure identifies concept overlap between lectures, determines concept co-occurrence within short windows, and the lecture where concepts occur first. The global direction measure incorporates time directly by analyzing the concept time ordering both globally and within lectures. Experiments over real-world MOOC data show that our method outperforms the baseline in both AUC and precision/recall curves. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Durand2018,"Knowledge tracing is a fundamental area of educational data modeling that aims at gaining a better understanding of the learning occurring in tutoring systems. Knowledge tracing models fit various parameters on observed student performance and are evaluated through several goodness of fit metrics. Fitted parameter values are of crucial interest in order to diagnose learning mastery as well as knowledge models and qualitative aspects of the learning environment. Unfortunately, parameter values are rarely associated with standard errors or confidence intervals, both of which are critical information to validate the inferences that can be made from the model. Taking the example of the Additive Factor Model, we describe how to obtain standard errors on the model parameters.

conference,WesCrues2018,"The diversity in reasons that students have for enrolling in massive open online courses (MOOCs) is an often-overlooked aspect while modeling learners’ behaviors in MOOCs. Using survey data from 11,202 students in five MOOCs spanning different academic disciplines, this study evaluates the reasons that students enrolled in MOOCs, using an unsupervised learning method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). After fitting an LDA model, we used correspondence analysis to understand whether these reasons were general, and could be invoked across the five MOOCs, or whether the reasons were course-specific. Furthermore, log-linear models were employed to understand the relations between the reasons students enrolled, the course they took, and their background characteristics. We found that students enrolled for many different reasons, and that their age was statistically related to the reasons they gave for taking a MOOC, but their gender was not. The paper concludes with a discussion of how instructors and course designers can use this information when creating new—or redesigning existing—MOOCs. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Slim2018,"Colleges are increasingly interested in identifying the factors that maximize their enrollment. These factors allow enrollment management administrators to identify the applicants who have higher tendency to enroll at their institutions and accordingly to better allocate their money rewards (i.e., scholarship and financial aid). In this paper we identify factors that affect the likelihood of enrolling. We use machine learning methods to statistically analyze the enrollment predictability of such factors. In particular, we use logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVMs) and semi-supervised probability methods. The LR and the SVMs methods predict the enrollment of applicants at an individual level whereas the semi-supervised probability method does that at a cohort level. We validate our methods using real data for applicants admitted to the university of New Mexico (UNM). The results show that a small set of factors related to student and college characteristics are highly correlated to the applicant decision of enrollment. This outcome is supported by the relatively high prediction accuracy of the proposed methods. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

We then show, using data collected from a simple second-language learning experiment, that fMRI data acquired during a learning session can be used to improve predictions about student memory at test.

In a previous study [1], we asked pairs (N=84) with no programming experience to program a robot to solve a series of mazes. The quality of the dyad’s collaboration was evaluated, and two interventions were implemented to support collaborative learning. In the current study, we present the analysis of Kinect™ and speech data gathered on dyads during the programming task. We first show how certain movements and patterns of gestures correlate positively with collaboration and learning gains. We next use clustering algorithms to find prototypical body positions of participants and relate amount of time spent in certain postures with learning gains as in Schneider & Blikstein’s work [2]. Finally, we examine measures of proxemics and physical orientation within the dyads to explore how to detect good collaboration.

conference,Karumbaiah2018,"Identifying struggling students in real-time provides a virtual learning environment with an opportunity to intervene meaningfully with supports aimed at improving student learning and engagement. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of quit prediction modeling in students playing a learning game called Physics Playground. From the interaction log data of the game, we engineered a comprehensive set of aggregated features of varying levels of granularity and trained individualized level-specific models and a single level-agnostic model. Contrary to our initial expectation, our results suggest that a level-agnostic model achieves superior predictive performance. We enhanced this model further with level-related and student-related features, leading to a moderate increase in AUC. Visualizing this model, we observe that it is based on high-level intuitive features that are generalizable across levels. This model can now be used in future work to automatically trigger cognitive and affective supports to motivate students to pursue a game level until completion. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Crossley2018,"A number of studies have demonstrated strong links between students' language features (as found in spoken and written production) and their math performance. However, no studies have examined links between the students’ language features and measures of their Math Identity. This project extends prior studies that use natural language processing (NLP) features to examine student language features and math performance, replicating their analyses. The study then uses NLP features to model students’ Math Identity. Specifically, the study compares performance on basic math skills within an online math tutoring system to both student language (as captured in emails to a virtual pedagogical agent) and to survey measures of Math Identity (math self concept, interest, and value). Language features were analyzed by a number of NLP tools that extracted information related to text cohesion, lexical sophistication, and sentiment. The findings indicate weak to medium relationships between math scores and Math Identity and language features were able to predict a significant amount of the variance in each Math Identity variable and in math scores. The potential for these measures to inform interventions for students with lower Math Identity is discussed. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Sales2018,"Randomized A/B tests in educational software are not run in a vacuum: often, reams of historical data are available alongside the data from a randomized trial. This paper proposes a method to use this historical data–often high-dimensional and longitudinal–to improve causal estimates from A/B tests. The method proceeds in two steps: first, fit a machine learning model to the historical data predicting students’ outcomes as a function of their covariates. Then, use that model to predict the outcomes of the randomized students in the A/B test. Finally, use design-based methods to estimate the treatment effect in the A/B test, using prediction errors in place of outcomes. This method retains all of the advantages of design-based inference, while, under certain conditions, yielding more precise estimators. This paper will give a theoretical condition under which the method improves statistical precision, and demonstrates it using a deep learning algorithm to help estimate effects in a set of experiments run inside ASSISTments. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Cook2018,"Automatic assessment of the quality of classroom discourse can have a transformative effect on research and practice on improving teaching effectiveness. We improve on a previous automated method to measure teacher authentic questions – open-ended questions without pre-scripted responses that predict student achievement growth – using classroom audio and expert question codes from two sources: (1) a large archival database of text transcripts of 428 class-sessions from 116 classrooms, and (2) a newly collected sample of 132 high-quality audio recordings with automatic speech recognition transcripts from 27 classrooms. Whereas previous work utilized a “closed vocabulary” approach, consisting of 732 pre-defined word, sentence, and discourse level features, the present “open vocabulary” approach exclusively utilized word and phrase counts from the transcripts themselves. The two approaches yielded substantial, but statistically equivalent, correlations with gold-standard human codes of authenticity (Pearson r’s of 0.396 vs. 0.424 and 0.602 vs. 0.613 for datasets 1 and 2, respectively). Importantly, averaging estimates from the two approaches resulted in statistically significant improvements over either approach (r’s of 0.492 and 0.686 for datasets 1 and 2, respectively).

conference,Cai2018,"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) plays an important role in analyzing text data from education settings. LSA represents meaning of words and sets of words by vectors from a k-dimensional space generated from a selected corpus. While the impact of the value of k has been investigated by many researchers, the impact of the selection of documents and the size of the corpus has never been systematically investigated. This paper tackles this problem based on the performance of LSA in evaluating learners’ answers to AutoTutor, a conversational intelligent tutoring system. We report the impact of document sources (Wikipedia vs TASA), selection algorithms (keyword based vs random), corpus size (from 2000 to 30000 documents) and number of dimensions (from 2 to 1000). Two AutoTutor tasks are used to evaluate the performance of different LSA spaces: a phrase level answer assessment (responses to focal prompt questions) and a sentence level answer assessment (responses to hints). We show that a sufficiently large (e.g., 20,000 to 30,000 documents) randomly selected Wikipedia corpus with high enough dimensions (about 300) could provide a reasonably good space. A specifically selected domain corpus could have significantly better performance with a relatively smaller corpus size (about 8000 documents) and much lower dimensionality (around 17). The widely used TASA corpus (37,651 documents scientifically sampled) performs equally well as a randomly selected large Wikipedia corpus (20,000 to 30,000) with a sufficiently high dimensionality (e.g., k>=300). © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Park2018,"Time management is crucial to success in online courses in which students can schedule their learning on a flexible basis. Procrastination is largely viewed as a failure of time management and has been linked to poorer outcomes for students. Past research has quantified the extent of students’ procrastination by defining single measures directly from raw logs of student activity. In this work, we use a probabilistic mixture model to allow different types of behavioral patterns to naturally emerge from clickstream data and analyze the resulting patterns in the context of procrastination. Moreover, we extend our analysis to include measures of student regularity–how consistent the procrastinating behaviors are–and construct a composite Time Management Score (TM). Our results show that mixture modeling is able to unveil latent types of behavior, each of which is associated with a level of procrastination and its regularity. Overall, students identified as non-procrastinators tend to perform significantly better. Within non-procrastinators, higher levels of regularity signify better performance, while this may be the opposite for procrastinators. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Fancsali2018,"Learners in various contemporary settings (e.g., K-12 classrooms, online courses, professional/vocational training) find themselves in situations in which they have access to multiple technology-based learning platforms and often one or more non-technological resources (e.g., human instructors or on-demand human tutors). Instructors, similarly, find themselves in situations in which they can provide learners with a variety of options for instruction, practice, homework, and other activities. We seek data-driven guidance to help facilitate intelligent instructional “hand offs” between learning resources. To begin this work, we focus on an important element of self-regulated learning, namely help seeking. We build classifier models based on proxies for learner prior knowledge and data-driven inferences about learners’ disengaged behavior (e.g., gaming the system) and affective states (e.g., confusion) to determine the extent to which (and when) learners tended to seek out help via human tutoring while using an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics. Insights into cognitive, behavioral, and affective factors associated with help seeking outside of a system will drive future work into providing automated, intelligent guidance to both learners and instructors.

conference,Chen2018,"Knowledge of prerequisite dependencies is crucial to several aspects of learning, from the organization of learning content to the selection of personalized remediation or enrichment for each learner. As the amount of content is scaled up, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually specify all of the prerequisites among the different content parts, necessitating automation. Since existing approaches to automatically inferring prerequisite dependencies rely on analysis of content (e.g., topic modeling of text) or performance (e.g., quiz results tied to content) data, they are not feasible in cases where courses have no assessments or only short content pieces (e.g., short video segments). In this paper, we propose an algorithm that extracts prerequisite information using learner behavioral data instead of content and performance data, and apply it to an online short course. By modeling learner interaction with course content through a recurrent neural network-based architecture, our algorithm characterizes the prerequisite structure as latent variables, and estimates them from learner behavior. Through evaluation on a dataset of roughly 12,000 learners in a course we hosted on our platform, we show that our algorithm excels at both predicting behavior and revealing fine-granular insights into prerequisite dependencies between content segments, with validation provided by a course administrator. Our approach of content analytics using large-scale behavioral data complements existing approaches that focus on course content and/or performance data. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Sawyer2018,"Student interactions with game-based learning environments produce a wide range of in-game problem-solving sequences. These sequences can be viewed as trajectories through a game’s problem-solving space. In this paper, we present a general framework for analyzing students’ problem-solving behavior in game-based learning environments by filtering their gameplay action sequences into time series representing trajectories through the game’s problem-solving space. This framework was investigated with data from a laboratory study conducted with 68 college students tasked with solving the problem scenario in a game-based learning environment for microbiology education, CRYSTAL ISLAND. Using this representation of student problem solving, we derive the slope of the problem-solving trajectories and lock-step Euclidean distance to an expert problem-solving trajectory. Analyses indicate that the trajectory slope and temporal distance to an expert path are both correlated with students’ normalized learning gains, as well as a complementary measure of in-game problem-solving performance. The results suggest that the filtered time series framework for analyzing student problem-solving behavior shows significant promise for assessing the temporal nature of student problem solving during game-based learning. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Naismith2018,"One commonly used measure of lexical sophistication is the Advanced Guiraud (AG; [9]), whose formula requires frequency band counts (e.g., COCA; [13]). However, the accuracy of this measure is affected by the particular 2000-word frequency list selected as the basis for its calculations [27]. For example, possible issues arise when frequency lists that are based solely on native speaker corpora are used as a target for second language (L2) learners (e.g., [8]) because the exposure frequencies for L2 learners may vary from that of native speakers. Such L2 variation from comparable native speakers may be due to first language (L1) culture, home country teaching materials, or the text types which L2 learners commonly encounter. This paper addresses the aforementioned problem through an English as a Second Language (ESL) frequency list validation. Our validation is established on two sources: (1) the New General Service List (NGSL; [4]) which is based on the Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) and (2) written data from the 4.2 million-word Pitt English Language Institute Corpus (PELIC). Using open-source data science tools and natural language processing technologies, the paper demonstrates that more distinct measurable lexical sophistication differences across levels are discernible when learner-oriented frequency lists (as compared to general corpora frequency lists) are used as part of a lexical measure such as AG. The results from this research will be useful in teaching contexts where lexical proficiency is measured or assessed, and for materials and test developers who rely on such lists as being representative of known vocabulary at different levels of proficiency. This research applies data-driven exploration of learner corpora to vocabulary acquisition and pedagogy, thus closing a loop between educational data mining and classroom applications. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Nguyen2018,"Recent works on Intelligent Tutoring Systems have focused on more complicated knowledge domains, which pose challenges in automated assessment of student performance. In particular, while the system can log every user action and keep track of the student’s solution state, it is unable to determine the hidden intermediate steps leading to such state or what the student is trying to achieve. In this paper, we show that this information can be acquired through data mining, along with the type, frequency and context of errors that students made. Our technique has been implemented as part of the student model in a tutor that teaches red-black trees. The system was evaluated on three semesters of student data. Analysis of the results shows that the proposed framework of error analysis can help the system in predicting student performance with good accuracy and the instructor in determining difficulties that students encounter, both individually and collectively as a class. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Mittal2018,"As education gets increasingly digitized, and intelligent tutoring systems gain commercial prominence, scalable assessment generation mechanisms become a critical requirement for enabling increased learning outcomes. Assessments provide a way to measure learners’ level of understanding and difficulty, and personalize their learning. There have been separate efforts in different areas to solve this by looking at different parts of the problem. This paper is a first effort to bring together techniques from diverse areas such as knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, inference on graphs, and pedagogy to generate automated assessments at scale. In this paper, we specifically address the problem of Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) generation for vocabulary learning assessments, specially catered to young learners (YL). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by asking human annotators to annotate the questions generated by the system based on relevance. We also compare our approach with one baseline model and report high usability of MCQs generated by our system compared to the baseline. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Du2018,"Behavioral records collected through course assessments, peer assignments, and programming assignments in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide multiple views about a student’s study style. Study behavior is correlated with whether or not the student can get a certificate or drop out from a course. It is of predominant importance to identify the particular behavioral patterns and establish an accurate predictive model for the learning results, so that tutors can give well-focused assistance and guidance on specific students. However, the behavioral records of individuals are usually very sparse; behavioral records between individuals are inconsistent in time and skewed in contents. These remain big challenges for the state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we engage the concept of subgroup as a trade-off to overcome the sparsity of individual behavioral records and inconsistency between individuals. We employ the framework of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM) to discover exceptional student behavior. Various model classes of EMM are applied on dropout rate analysis, correlation analysis between length of learning behavior sequence and course grades, and passing state prediction analysis. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on real MOOCs datasets show that our method can discover significantly interesting learning behavioral patterns of students. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Fang2018,"A common goal of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) is to provide learning environments that adapt to the varying abilities and characteristics of users. To do this, researchers must identify the learning patterns exhibited by those interacting with the system. In the present work, we use clustering analysis to capture learning patterns in over 250 adults who used the ITS, CSAL (Center for the Study of Adult Literacy) AutoTutor, to gain reading comprehension skills. AutoTutor has conversational agentsth at teach literacy adults with low literacy skills comprehension strategies in 35 lessons. These comprehension strategies align with one or more of the following levels specified in the Graesser-McNamara theoretical framework of comprehension: word, textbase, situation model and rhetorical structure. We used the adult learners’ average response times per question and performance across lessons to cluster the students’ learning behavior. Performance was measured as the proportion of 3-alternative-response questions answered correctly. Lessons were coded on one of the four theoretical levels of comprehension. Results of the cluster analyses converged on four types of learners: proficient readers, struggling readers, conscientious readers and disengaged readers. Proficient readers were fast and accurate; struggling readers worked slowly but were not accurate; conscientious readers worked slowly and performed comparatively well; disengaged readers were fast but did not perform well. Interestingly, the behaviors of learners in different clusters varied across the four theoretical levels. Identifying types of readers can enhance the adaptivity of AutoTutor by allowing for more personalized feedback and interventions designed for particular learning behaviors. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Xu2018,"In most contexts of student skills assessment, whether the test material is administered by the teacher or within a learning environment, there is a strong incentive to minimize the number of questions or exercises administered in order to get an accurate assessment. This minimization objective can be framed as a Q-matrix design problem: given a set of skills to assess and a fixed number of question items, determine the optimal set of items, out of a potentially large pool, that will yield the most accurate assessment. In recent years, the Q-matrix identifiability under DINA/DINO models has been proposed as a guiding principle for that purpose. We empirically investigate the extent to which identifiability can serve that purpose. Identifiability of Q-matrices is studied throughout a range of conditions in an effort to measure and understand its relation to student skills assessment. The investigation relies on simulation studies of skills assessment with synthetic data. Results show that identifiability is an important factor that determines the capacity of a Q-matrix to lead to accurate skills assessment with the least number of questions. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

First, in order to overcome this limitation, we explore if poorly performing students can be more accurately predicted by formulating the problem as binary classification. Second, in order to gain insights as to which are the factors that can lead to poor performance, we engineered a number of human-interpretable features that quantify these factors.

conference,Chaudhry2018,"Interactive learning environments facilitate learning by providing hints to fill the gaps in the understanding of a concept. Studies suggest that hints are not used optimally by learners. Either they are used unnecessarily or not used at all. It has been shown that learning outcomes can be improved by providing hints when needed. An effective hint-taking prediction model can be used by a learning environment to make adaptive decisions on whether to withhold or provide hints. Past work on student behavior modeling has focused extensively on the task of modeling a learner’s state of knowledge over time, referred to as knowledge tracing. The other aspects of a learner’s behavior such as tendency to use hints has garnered limited attention. Past knowledge tracing models either ignore the questions where a hint was taken or label hints taken as an incorrect response. We propose a multi-task memory-augmented deep learning model to jointly predict the hint-taking and the knowledge tracing task. The model incorporates the effect of past responses as well as hints taken on both the tasks. We apply the model on two datasets – ASSISTments 2009-10 skill builder dataset and Junyi Academy Math Practicing Log. The results show that deep learning models efficiently leverage the sequential information present in a learner’s responses. The proposed model significantly out-performs the past work on hint prediction by at least 12% points. Moreover, we demonstrate that jointly modeling the two tasks improves performance consistently across the tasks and the datasets, albeit by a small amount. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Then, we verified the theme by comparing the topics assigned by LDA model on a test set with manual annotation. We also performed sentiment analysis to check for alignment with human judgment. Learner motivations in each theme were interpreted with the Expectancy-Value-Cost framework. Our analyses indicated that, primarily, learners were motivated to purchase the SoP based on perceptions of the utility value and financial cost of the certificate.

conference,Hayashi2018,"This study investigated the factors underlying the estimation of learner self-confidence during explanations with a conversational agent in an online explanation task. Based on reviews of previous studies, we focused on how factors such as the learner’s task activities and personal characteristics can be predictors. To examine these points, we used an online explanation task, which was run by a conversational agent for students in a classroom on information processing psychology (n=99). We asked the participants to make text-based explanations to the agent in a question- and-answer (Q&A) style, and clarified a particular concept that was taught in a previous lecture in the class. The results show that an increase in the amount of actual task work for explanations and personal characteristics (such as social skills) helped to predict higher self-confidence. The findings have implications not only for knowledge of how such factors might influence learner self-confidence in an online explanation task, but also for the design of online tutoring systems that can automatically detect learner confidence using these variables, and facilitate learning adequately based on such data. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Wang2018,"Academic achievement of a student in college always has a far-reaching impact on his further development. With the rise of the ubiquitous sensing technology, students’ digital footprints in campus can be collected to gain insights into their daily behaviours and predict their academic achievements. In this paper, we propose a framework named AAP-EDM (Academic Achievement Prediction via Educational Data Mining) to predict students’ academic achievements based on the influencing factors we have discovered. Multi-source heterogeneous data including Wi-Fi detection records, usage of smartcards, usage of campus network, is aggregated firstly. Then, instead of the self-reported features or traditional academic assessments like test scores, we extract features reflecting students’ behavioural patterns. Specially, we define DOH (Degree of Hardworking) to improve the performance of the classifier. Finally, we analyze the features extracted and apply supervised learning methods to predict their academic achievements.

conference,Carvalho2018,"Students who actively engage with learning materials, for example by completing more practice activities, show better learning outcomes. A straightforward step to stimulate this desirable behavior is to require students to complete activities and downplay the role of reading materials. However, this approach might have undesirable consequences, such as inflating the number of activities completed in a short period of time until maximum performance is achieved (“gaming the system”). In this paper, we analyze the relative benefits of completing activities vs. readings for learning outcomes in an online course that required students to perform practice activities. The results show that students who read more pages have better learning outcomes than students who completed more activities. This pattern of results holds even when considering different measures of active engagement but is reversed when considering only activities classified as effective active engagement by a “gaming behavior” classifier. Overall, these results suggest that, when completing activities is required, students benefit from complementing the activities with optional readings. One possibility is that completing optional readings can be an active learning activity in itself, driven by students who are going beyond the minimum requirement, and actively seeking further information and robust feedback that complements the activities. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Aguerrebere2018,"When implementing large-scale educational computing initiatives (e.g., One Laptop Per Child) it is vital to allocate resources for training, support, and device deployment judiciously. One question that arises is how learners’ engagement with online educational resources is affected by receiving a new computer; do the benefits justify the costs? In this paper, we perform a quasi-experimental analysis to measure the effect of new device deployment on students’ online learning activity, operationalized as either the number of interaction events with their LMS, or the number of attempted exercises in their math ITS. The focus is on 6th-grade learners in Uruguay, which to-date has delivered over 750,000 computers to pupils nationwide. Our results suggest that, relative to learners’ online learning activity before device deployment, the absolute effects are small but the relative effect are stat. sig. and surprisingly strong: the estimated relative increase on 2016 students’ overall LMS activity is 49%. The effects are positive for both 2015 and 2016 and persist several months after device delivery. Moreover, we find that students attempt to solve stat. sig. more (88%) math problems during the month after they receive a new device.

We investigate pairs of specific wrong answers given with unusual frequency by students on the pretest. We also identify transitions between pre- and post-test answers on the same question which elucidate student learning due to instruction. We define criteria for excess transitions above a random response model. Some common transitions are found to be associated specifically with students within a particular range of skills. Further, transitions from pre- to post-test revealed that incorrect pretest answers that were frequently repeated on the post-test often correspond to known misconceptions from physics or math. Thus, our data mining techniques can elucidate common student misunderstandings of mechanics concepts and how instruction affects these misunderstandings.

conference,Winchell2018,"When engaging with a textbook, students are inclined to highlight key content. Although students believe that highlighting and subsequent review of the highlights will further their educational goals, the psychological literature provides no evidence of benefits. Nonetheless, a student’s choice of text for highlighting may serve as a window into their mental state—their level of comprehension, grasp of the key ideas, reading goals, etc. We explore this hypothesis via an experiment in which 198 participants read sections from a college-level biology text, briefly reviewed the text, and then took a quiz on the material. During initial reading, participants were able to highlight words, phrases, and sentences, and these highlights were displayed along with the complete text during the subsequent review. Consistent with past research, the amount of highlighted material is unrelated to quiz performance. However, our main goal is to examine highlighting as a data source for inferring student understanding. We explored multiple representations of the highlighting patterns and tested Bayesian linear regression and neural network models, but we found little or no relationship between a student’s highlights and quiz performance. Our long-term goal is to design digital textbooks that serve not only as conduits of information into the mind of the reader, but also allow us to draw inferences about the reader at a point where interventions may increase the effectiveness of the material. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Hoernle2018,Simulations that combine real world components with interactive digital media provide a rich setting for students with the potential to assist knowledge building and understanding of complex physical processes. This paper addresses the problem of modeling the effects of multiple students’ simultaneous interactions on the complex and exploratory environments such simulations provide. We work towards assisting educators with the difficult task of interpreting student exploration. We represent the system dynamics that result from student actions with a complex time series and use switch based models to decompose the time series into individual periods that target interpretability for teachers. The model learns the transition points between successive periods in the time series as well as the internal dynamics that govern each period. This model differs from other switch based models in that it decomposes the time series in a way that is human interpretable. This approach was applied to data that was obtained from an existing multi-person simulation with pedagogical goals of teaching sustainability and systems thinking. A visualization of the model was designed to validate the interpretability of the generated text-based descriptions when compared to a movie representation of the system dynamics. A pilot study using this visualization indicates that the switch based model finds relevant boundaries between salient periods of student work. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Montero2018,"Personalized learning environments requiring the elicitation of a student’s knowledge state have inspired researchers to propose distinct models to understand that knowledge state. Recently, the spotlight has shone on comparisons between traditional, interpretable models such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and complex, opaque neural network models such as Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Although DKT appears to be a powerful predictive model, little effort has been expended to dissect the source of its strength. We begin with the observation that DKT differs from BKT along three dimensions: (1) DKT is a neural network with many free parameters, whereas BKT is a probabilistic model with few free parameters; (2) a single instance of DKT is used to model all skills in a domain, whereas a separate instance of BKT is constructed for each skill; and (3) the input to DKT interlaces practice from multiple skills, whereas the input to BKT is separated by skill. We tease apart these three dimensions by constructing versions of DKT which are trained on single skills and which are trained on sequences separated by skill. Exploration of three data sets reveals that dimensions (1) and (3) are critical; dimension (2) is not. Our investigation gives us insight into the structural regularities in the data that DKT is able to exploit but that BKT cannot. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Khosravi20174,"Various forms of Peer-Learning Environments are increasingly being used in post-secondary education, often to help build repositories of student generated learning objects. However, large classes can result in an extensive repository, which can make it more challenging for students to search for suitable objects that both reflect their interests and address their knowledge gaps. Recommender Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (RecSysTEL) offer a potential solution to this problem by providing sophisticated filtering techniques to help students to find the resources that they need in a timely manner. Here, a new RecSysTEL for Recommendation in Peer-Learning Environments (RiPLE) is presented. The approach uses a collaborative filtering algorithm based upon matrix factorization to create personalized recommendations for individual students that address their interests and their current knowledge gaps. The approach is validated using both synthetic and real data sets. The results are promising, indicating RiPLE is able to provide sensible personalized recommendations for both regular and cold-start users under reasonable assumptions about parameters and user behavior. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Specifically, the study explores the relationship between students' academic achievement and their persistence during learning. By using archived data that included their math learning log data and performance on two standardized tests, we first explored student learning behavior patterns with regard to their persistence during learning. Clustering analysis identified three distinctive patterns of persistence-related learning behaviors: (1) High persistence and rare topic shifting; (2) Low persistence and frequent topic shifting; and (3) Moderate persistence and moderate topic shifting. We further explored the association between persistence and academic achievement. No significant differences were observed between academic achievement and the different learning patterns.

conference,Robson2017416,"As EDM and AIED innovations proliferate, the ability for diverse products to consistently interpret each other’s data will emerge as a critical issue. Formal data interoperability standards that enable diverse datasets to be curated, accessed, merged/compared and fruitfully analyzed will play a crucial role in research and in the successful mass adoption of products based on that research, as will standards that enable systems to produce data that can be mined by existing and yet-to-be-invented algorithms. Yet this important topic is often neglected by researchers and system developers, who naturally focus on the specific problems they set out to solve and do not consider how they can either contribute or consume data produced by other systems or how their innovations will fit into larger ecosystems. This tutorial is intended to: • Raise awareness of the role of standards and their criticality for EDM and AIED; • Provide participants with an understanding of the nature, status, and current activity of multiple international standards development effort relevant to educational data; • Provide participants with insight into how they can beneficially apply standards and, in some cases, contribute to their development. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Hansen2017232,"The analysis of log data generated by online educational systems is an important task for improving the systems, and furthering our knowledge of how students learn. This paper uses previously unseen log data from Edulab, the largest provider of digital learning for mathematics in Denmark, to analyse the sessions of its users, where 1.08 million student sessions are extracted from a subset of their data. We propose to model students as a distribution of different underlying student behaviours, where the sequence of actions from each session belongs to an underlying student behaviour. We model student behaviour as Markov chains, such that a student is modelled as a distribution of Markov chains, which are estimated using a modified k-means clustering algorithm. The resulting Markov chains are readily interpretable, and in a qualitative analysis around 125,000 student sessions are identified as exhibiting unproductive student behaviour. Based on our results this student representation is promising, especially for educational systems offering many different learning usages, and offers an alternative to common approaches like modelling student behaviour as a single Markov chain often done in the literature. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Xue2017296,"Augmented Graph Grammars are a graph-based rule formalism that supports rich relational structures. They can be used to represent complex social networks, chemical structures, and student-produced argument diagrams for automated analysis or grading. In prior work we have shown that Evolutionary Computation (EC) can be applied to induce empirically-valid grammars for student-produced argument diagrams based upon fitness selection. However this research has shown that while the traditional EC algorithm does converge to an optimal fitness, premature convergence can lead to it getting stuck in local maxima, which may lead to undiscovered rules. In this work, we augmented the standard EC algorithm to induce more heterogeneous Augmented Graph Grammars by replacing the fitness selection with a novelty-based selection mechanism every ten generations. Our results show that this novelty selection increases the diversity of the population and produces better, and more heterogeneous, grammars. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,D’Mello20178,"Mind wandering, defined as shifts in attention from task-related processing to task-unrelated thoughts, is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has a negative influence on performance and productivity in many contexts, including learning. We propose that next-generation learning technologies should have some mechanism to detect and respond to mind wandering in real-time. Towards this end, we developed a technology that automatically detects mind wandering from eye-gaze during learning from instructional texts. When mind wandering is detected, the technology intervenes by posing just-in-time questions and encouraging re-reading as needed. After multiple rounds of iterative refinement, we summatively compared the technology to a yoked-control in an experiment with 104 participants. The key dependent variable was performance on a post-reading comprehension assessment. Our results suggest that the technology was successful in correcting comprehension deficits attributed to mind wandering (d = .47 sigma) under specific conditions, thereby highlighting the potential to improve learning by “attending to attention.” © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Hong2017358,"Students experience considerable challenge in STEM coursework and many struggle to earn the grades needed to move forward in their majors. Interventions informed by prediction models can support learners to ensure successful completion of STEM courses and entry into the STEM workforce. In order to accurately target intervention efforts, we developed a prediction model based on log data generated by student use of content hosted on a learning management system (LMS; Blackboard Learn) course site in the first weeks of the course. The prediction model employed a forward selection logistic regression algorithm (with 10-fold cross validation) trained on four semesters of data, and provided instructors the opportunity to message students and provide learning support before the first major exam, potentially intervening before onset of poor performance. The best fitting model was used to identify students unlikely to obtain the required grade (B or better) in the course. Among 106 students predicted to perform poorly, 63 received a message from the instructor’s account that referenced an upcoming exam and linked students to supportive materials. Messaged students who accessed learning supports outperformed non-messaged but eligible students (n = 43) on each of five subsequent exams throughout the semester (ds = .64 - .88). Fifty-eight percent earned a B or better, compared to 25% of non-messaged peers predicted to earn a C or worse.

conference,Ren201748,"There is a critical need to develop new educational technology applications that analyze the data collected by universities to ensure that students graduate in a timely fashion (4 to 6 years); and they are well prepared for jobs in their respective fields of study. In this paper, we present a novel approach for analyzing historical educational records from a large, public university to perform next-term grade prediction; i.e., to estimate the grades that a student will get in a course that he/she will enroll in the next term. Accurate next-term grade prediction holds the promise for better student degree planning, personalized advising and automated interventions to ensure that students stay on track in their chosen degree program and graduate on time. We present a factorization-based approach called Matrix Factorization with Temporal Course-wise Influence that incorporates course-wise influence effects and temporal effects for grade prediction. In this model, students and courses are represented in a latent “knowledge” space. The grade of a student on a course is modeled as the similarity of their latent representation in the “knowledge” space. Course-wise influence is considered as an additional factor in the grade prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline approaches and infer meaningful patterns between pairs of courses within academic programs. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Geigle20176,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide educators with an abundance of data describing how students interact with the platform, but this data is highly underutilized today. This is in part due to the lack of sophisticated tools to provide interpretable and actionable summaries of huge amounts of MOOC activity present in log data. To address this problem, we propose a student behavior representation method alongside a method for automatically discovering those student behavior patterns by leveraging the click log data that can be obtained from the MOOC platform itself. Specifically, we propose the use of a two-layer hidden Markov model (2L-HMM) to extract our desired behavior representation, and show that patterns extracted by such a 2L-HMM are interpretable, meaningful, and unique. We demonstrate that features extracted from a trained 2L-HMM can be shown to correlate with educational outcomes. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Waters2017374,"Educational technology commonly leverages multiple-choice questions for student practice, but short-answer questions hold the potential to provide better learning outcomes. Unfortunately, students in online settings often exhibit little effort when crafting short-answer responses, instead often produce off-topic (or invalid) responses that are off-topic and do not relate to the question being answered. In this study, we consider the effect of entering on-topic short-answer response on student learning and retention. To do this, we first develop a machine learning method to automatically label student open-form responses as either valid or invalid using a small amount of hand-labeled training data. Then, using data from several high school AP Biology and Physics classes, we present evidence that providing valid short-answer responses creates a positive educational benefit on later practice. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Lallé2017120,"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between students’ learning gains and their compliance with prompts fostering self-regulated learning (SRL) during interaction with MetaTutor, a hypermedia-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). When possible, we evaluate compliance from student explicit answers on whether they want to follow the prompts, When such answers are not available, we mine several student behaviors related to prompt compliance. These behaviors are derived from students’ eye-tracking and interaction data (e.g., time spent on a learning page, number of gaze fixations on that page). Our results reveal that compliance with some, but not all SRL prompts provided by MetaTutor do influence learning. These results contribute to gain a better understanding of how students benefit from SRL prompts, and provides insights on how to further improve their effectiveness. For instance, prompts that do improve learning when followed could be the focus of adaptation designed to foster compliance for those students who would disregard them otherwise. Conversely, prompts that do not improve learning when followed could be improved based on further investigations to understand the reason for their lack of effectiveness. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Lan201764,"We propose a new model for learning that relates video-watching behavior and engagement to quiz performance. In our model, a learner’s knowledge gain from watching a lecture video is treated as proportional to their latent engagement level, and the learner’s engagement is in turn dictated by a set of behavioral features we propose that quantify the learner’s interaction with the lecture video. A learner’s latent concept knowledge is assumed to dictate their observed performance on in-video quiz questions. One of the advantages of our method for determining engagement is that it can be done entirely within standard online learning platforms, serving as a more universal and less invasive alternative to existing measures of engagement that require the use of external devices. We evaluate our method on a real-world massive open online course (MOOC) dataset, from which we find that it achieves high quality in terms of predicting unobserved first-attempt quiz responses, outperforming two state-of-the-art baseline algorithms on all metrics and dataset partitions tested. We also find that our model enables the identification of key behavioral features (e.g., larger numbers of pauses and rewinds, and smaller numbers of fast forwards) that are correlated with higher learner engagement. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Wang2017290,"Existing personalized learning systems (PLSs) have primarily focused on providing learning analytics using data from learners. In this paper, we extend the capability of current PLSs by incorporating data from instructors. We propose a latent factor model that analyzes instructors’ preferences in explicitly excluding particular questions from learners’ assignments in a particular subject domain. We formulate the problem of predicting instructors’ question exclusion preferences as a matrix factorization problem, and incorporate expert-labeled Bloom’s Taxonomy tags on each question as a factor in our statistical model to improve model interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world educational dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction performance compared to several other baseline methods commonly used in recommender systems. Additionally, by explicitly incorporating Bloom’s Taxonomy, the model provides meaningful interpretations that help understand why instructors exclude certain questions. Since instructor preference data contains their insights after years of teaching experience, our proposed model has the potential to further improve the question recommendations that PLSs make for learners. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Ju-Lu2017430,"The present study aimed at proposing a Chinese automated essay scoring model to assess college students writing quality. Thirty-one related Chinese linguistic indicators were developed based on Coh-Metrix indices and characteristics of Chinese texts. Essay collected from 277 college students were analyzed using automated Chinese text analyze tool. A stepwise regression was used to explain the variance in human scores. The number of words, number of low strokes, content words frequency, minimal edit distance (all words) and minimum frequency for content words predicted 55.8% variance in human scores. On the other hand, seven indicators: number of words, content words frequency, concreteness, Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity, minimal edit distance (part of speech), minimal edit distance (all words) and words per sentence were predictive of human essay ratings by using discriminant analysis. The present study further explored the effectiveness of the Chinese automated essay scoring model by using three different methods: stepwise linear regression, discriminant analysis, and Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction classification (NWFE). The preliminary results showed that NWFE classification method produced higher exact matches (51.3%) between the predicted essay scores and the human scores than stepwise regression (47.3%) and discriminant analysis (47.3%). © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Michalenko2017208,"An important, yet largely unstudied problem in student data analysis is to detect misconceptions from students’ responses to open-response questions. Misconception detection enables instructors to deliver more targeted feedback on the misconceptions exhibited by many students in their class, thus improving the quality of instruction. In this paper, we propose a new natural language processing-based framework to detect the common misconceptions among students’ textual responses to short-answer questions. We propose a probabilistic model for students’ textual responses involving misconceptions and experimentally validate it on a real-world student-response dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed framework excels at classifying whether a response exhibits one or more misconceptions. More importantly, it can also automatically detect the common misconceptions exhibited across responses from multiple students to multiple questions; this property is especially important at large scale, since instructors will no longer need to manually specify all possible misconceptions that students might exhibit. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Xue2017439,"Current automated essay grading systems are typically focused on the semantic and syntax analysis of written arguments via Natural Language Processing techniques. Few systems focus on the automatic assessment of argument structure. In this work, we propose to build an Intelligent Argument Grading System to automatically assess and provide feedback on the structure of arguments of student-produced argument diagrams, which are graphical representations for real-word argumentation. The proposed system contains two stages. In the first, it automatically induces empirically-valid graph rules for expert-graded argument diagrams. An assessment model is trained from the dataset of manually-graded argument diagrams with the feature of induced graph rules. In the second stage, the assessment model automatically grades and provides feedback by identifying both good features and structural flaws in students’ work. The significance of this work will be that the proposed system can save high cost of labor by automatically inducing empirically-valid rules, grading, and providing feedback on the structure of arguments for students. We anticipate that the automatic feedback can help students revise their structural plans accordingly before they start to write essays, which will in turn lead them to produce more high-quality arguments. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

To do it, we propose the use of the multi-label classification approach, since each LO might be simultaneously associated with multiple labels. An initial problem we have found is that the number of terms or pure text features that characterize LOs tends to be very high. So, we propose to apply a dimensionality reduction process.

conference,Wang2017324,"Modeling student knowledge while students are acquiring new concepts is a crucial stepping stone towards providing personalized automated feedback at scale. We believe that rich information about a student’s learning is captured within her responses to open-ended problems with unbounded solution spaces, such as programming exercises. In addition, sequential snapshots of a student’s progress while she is solving a single exercise can provide valuable insights into her learning behavior. Creating representations for a student’s knowledge state is a challenging task, but with recent advances in machine learning, there are more promising techniques to learn representations for complex entities. In our work, we feed the embedded program submission sequence into a recurrent neural network and train it on two tasks of predicting the student’s future performance. By training on these tasks, the model learns nuanced representations of a student’s knowledge, exposes patterns about a student’s learning behavior, and reliably predicts future student performance. Even more importantly, the model differentiates within a pool of poorly performing students and picks out students who have true knowledge gaps, giving teachers early warnings to provide assistance. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Nam201780,"We show how the novel use of a semantic representation based on Osgood’s semantic differential scales can lead to effective features in predicting short- and long-term learning in students using a vocabulary learning system. Previous studies in students’ intermediate knowledge states during vocabulary acquisition did not provide much information on which semantic knowledge students gained during word learning practice. Moreover, these studies relied on human ratings to evaluate the students’ responses. To solve this problem, we propose a semantic representation for words based on Osgood’s semantic decomposition of vocabulary [16]. To demonstrate our method can effectively represent students’ knowledge in vocabulary acquisition, we build models for predicting the student’s short-term vocabulary acquisition and long-term retention. We compare the effectiveness of our Osgood-based semantic representation to that provided by Word2Vec neural word embedding [13], and find that prediction models using features based on Osgood scale-based scores (OSG) perform better than the baseline and are comparable in accuracy to those using Word2Vec score-based models (W2V). By using more interpretable Osgood-based scales, our study results can help with better understanding of students’ ongoing learning states and designing personalized learning systems that can address an individual’s weak points in vocabulary acquisition. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

We then evaluated the effectiveness of the two rule sets against a baseline Random condition in which the tutor made random yet reasonable decisions. We explored two types of trees (weighted and unweighted) as well as two pruning strategies (pre- and post-pruning). We found that post-pruned weighted trees produced the best results with 529 DT-RL rules. The empirical evaluation was conducted in a classroom study using an existing Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) named Pyrenees. 153 students were randomly assigned to three conditions. The procedure was the same for all students with domain content and required steps strictly controlled. The only substantive differences between the three conditions were the policy: (Full-RL vs. DT-RL vs. Random). Our result showed that as expected the machine induced policies (Full-RL and DT-RL) are significantly more effective than the random policy; more importantly, no significant difference was found between the Full-RL and DT-RL policies though the number of DT-RL rules is less than 15% of the number of the Full-RL rules and the former group also took significantly less time than the latter. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

The central goal of this study is to investigate how learning strategies are related to student success in an online adaptive mathematics tutoring system. To accomplish this goal, we developed a model to predict student performance based on their strategies in ALEKS, an online learning environment. We have identified student learning strategies and behaviors in seven main categories: help-seeking, multiple consecutive errors, learning from errors, switching to a new topic, topic mastery, reviewing previous mastered topics, and changes in behavior over time. The model, developed by using stepwise logistic regression, indicated that requesting two consecutive explanations, making consecutive errors and requesting an explanation, and changes in learning behaviors over time, were associated with lower success rates in the semester-end assessment. By contrast, the reviewing previous mastered topics strategy was a positive predictor of success in the last assessment.

In order to determine whether adults with low literacy skills would be able to use an intelligent tutoring system for reading comprehension, we adapted a 44 task computer literacy assessment and delivered it to 114 adults with reading skills between 3rd and 8th grade levels. This paper presents four analyses on these data. First, we report the pass/fail data natively exported by the assessment for particular computer-based tasks. Second, we undertook a GOMS analysis of each computer-based task, to predict the task completion time for a skilled user, and found that it negatively correlated with proportion correct for each item, r(42) = −.4, p = .01. Third, we used the GOMS task decomposition to develop a Q-matrix of component computer skills for each task, and using logistic mixed effects models on this matrix identified five component skills highly predictive of the success or failure of an individual on a computer task: function keys, typing, using icons, right clicking, and mouse dragging. And finally, we assessed the predictive value of all component skills using logistic lasso. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Balyan2017244,"This study examined how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to assess the interpretive behavior that is required for successful literary text comprehension. We compared the accuracy of seven different machine learning classification algorithms in predicting human ratings of student essays about literary works. Three types of NLP feature sets: unigrams (single content words), elaborative (new) n-grams, and linguistic features were used to classify idea units (paraphrase, text-based inference, interpretive inference). The most accurate classifications emerged using all three NLP features sets in combination, with accuracy ranging from 0.61 to 0.94 (F=0.18 to 0.81). Random Forests, which employs multiple decision trees and a bagging approach, was the most accurate classifier for these data. In contrast, the single classifier, Trees, which tends to “overfit” the data during training, was the least accurate. Ensemble classifiers were generally more accurate than single classifiers. However, Support Vector Machines accuracy was comparable to that of the ensemble classifiers. This is likely due to Support Vector Machines’ unique ability to support high dimension feature spaces. The findings suggest that combining the power of NLP and machine learning is an effective means of automating literary text comprehension assessment. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Mi201724,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have demonstrated growing popularity and rapid development in recent years. Discussion forums have become crucial components for students and instructors to widely exchange ideas and propagate knowledge. It is important to recommend helpful information from forums to students for the benefit of the learning process. However, students or instructors update discussion forums very often, and the student preferences over forum contents shift rapidly as a MOOC progresses. So, MOOC forum recommendations need to be adaptive to these evolving forum contents and drifting student interests. These frequent changes pose a challenge to most standard recommendation methods as they have difficulty adapting to new and drifting observations. We formalize the discussion forum recommendation problem as a sequence prediction problem. Then we compare different methods, including a new method called context tree (CT), which can be effectively applied to online sequential recommendation tasks. The results show that the CT recommender performs better than other methods for MOOCs forum recommendation task. We analyze the reasons for this and demonstrate that it is because of better adaptation to changes in the domain. This highlights the importance of considering the adaptation aspect when building recommender system with drifting preferences, as well as using machine learning in general. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,An2017220,"The emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has enabled new research to analyze typical behaviors of learners. In this paper, we investigate whether this research is generalizable to other courses that are backed by a learning management system (LMS) as MOOCs are. Building on methods developed by others, we characterize individual learning behaviors in different ways taking into account specificities of the LMS we use. We then apply clustering techniques to uncover typical behaviors in two university courses. One course, JavaFX, teaching about the software programming framework, has been offered as a supplementary online course to students enrolled in an online degree. Enrolling in this course was voluntary and students did not earn any credit towards their degree; in this sense, the JavaFX course bears similarities to a MOOC though it is neither massive nor open to everybody. The other course is a classical face-to-face course on Advanced Web Technologies (AWT) backed by our LMS; students earn a degree when they pass the final exam. It turns out that the different characterizations of individual learning behaviors are consistent for the JavaFX course and uncover typical behaviors reminiscent of those found by others in MOOCs, while they aren’t as applicable to the AWT course. However, typical behaviors found in the AWT course give insights on styles that lead to better marks. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Results showed significant correlations between students who received more empathic messages and those who were more confident, more patient, exhibited higher levels of interest, and valued math knowledge more. Students who received more growth mindset messages, tended to get more problems correct on their first attempt but valued math knowledge less and had lower posttest scores. Students who received more success/failure messages tended to make more mistakes, to be less learning-oriented, and stated that they were more confused.

In this paper, we describe an approach for rapport detection in peer tutoring, using temporal association rules learned from nonverbal, social, and on-task verbal behaviors. From a corpus of 60 hours of annotated multimodal peer tutoring data, we learn the temporal association between behaviors and the rapport score for each 30-second “thin-slice”. We then train a stacked ensemble classification model on those association rules and evaluate our ability to reliably predict rapport using multimodal behavioral data. We find that our approach allows us to predict rapport well above chance, and more accurately than two baseline models. We are able to predict high rapport more accurately for strangers and low rapport more accurately for friends, which we believe holds promise for the integration of rapport detection into collaborative learning supports and intelligent tutoring systems. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Ekambaram2017454,"Children are inherently curious and rapidly learn a number of things from the physical environments they live in, including rich vocabulary. An effective way of building vocabulary is for the child to actually interact with physical objects in their surroundings and learn in their context [17]. Enabling effective learning from the physical world with digital technologies is, however, challenging. Specifically, a critical technology component for physical-digital interaction is visual recognition. The recognition accuracy provided by state-of-the-art computer vision services is not sufficient for use in Early Childhood Learning (ECL); without high (near 100%) recognition accuracy of objects in context, learners may be presented with wrongly contextualized content and concepts, thereby making the learning solutions ineffective and un-adoptable. In this paper, we present a holistic visual recognition system for ECL physical-digital interaction that improves recognition accuracy levels using (a) domain restriction, (b) multi-modal fusion of contextual information, and (c) semi-automated feedback with different gaming scenarios for right object-tag identification & classifier re-training. We evaluate the system with a group of 12 children in the age group of 3-5 years and show how these new systems can combine existing APIs and techniques in interesting ways to greatly improve accuracies, and hence make such new learning experiences possible. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Supraja201756,"Expertise in a domain of knowledge is characterized by a greater fluency for solving problems within that domain and a greater facility for transferring the structure of that knowledge to other domains. Deliberate practice and the feedback that takes place during practice activities serve as gateways for developing domain expertise. However, there is a difficulty in consistently aligning feedback about a learner’s practice performance with the intended learning outcomes of those activities – especially in situations where the person providing feedback is unfamiliar with the intention of those activities. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent model to automatically label opportunities for practice (assessment questions) according to the learning outcomes intended by the course designers. As a proof of concept, we used a reduced version of Bloom’s Taxonomy to define the intended learning outcomes. Using a factorial design, we employed term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to transform questions from text to word weightages with support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) to train and automatically label the questions. We trained our models with 120 questions labeled by the subject matter expert of an undergraduate engineering course. Compared to existing works which create models based on a self-generated dataset, our proposed approach uses 30 untrained questions from online/textbook sources to validate the performance of our models. Exhaustive comparison analysis of the testing set showed that TF-IDF with ELM outperformed the other combinations by yielding 0.86 reliability (F1 measure) with the subject matter expert. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Each of them is quantified by the aggregated frequency. Then we examine the correlation between pre-knowledge and each type of engagement behavior.

conference,Doroudi2017143,"In this paper, we investigate two purported problems with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), a popular statistical model of student learning: identifiability and semantic model degeneracy. In 2007, Beck and Chang stated that BKT is susceptible to an identifiability problem—various models with different parameters can give rise to the same predictions about student performance. We show that the problem they pointed out was not an identifiability problem, and using an existing result from the identifiability of hidden Markov models, we show that under mild conditions on the parameters, BKT is actually identifiable. In the second part of the paper, we discuss a problem that has been conflated with identifiability, but which actually does arise when fitting BKT models, semantic model degeneracy—the model parameters that best fit the data are inconsistent with the conceptual assumptions underlying BKT. We give some intuition for why semantic model degeneracy may arise by showing that BKT models fit to data generated from alternative models of student learning can have semantically degenerate parameters.

conference,Liu2017135,"Research in Educational Data Mining could benefit from greater efforts to ensure that models yield reliable, valid, and interpretable parameter estimates. These efforts have especially been lacking for individualized student-parameter models. We collected two datasets from a sizable student population with excellent “depth” – that is, many observations for each skill for each student. We fit two models, the Individualized-slope Additive Factors Model (iAFM) and Individualized Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (iBKT), both of which individualize for student ability and student learning rate. Estimates of student ability were reliable and valid: they were consistent across both models and across both datasets, and they significantly predicted out-of-tutor pretest data. In one of the datasets, estimates of student learning rate were reliable and valid: consistent across models and significantly predictive of pretest-posttest gains. This is the first demonstration that statistical models of data resulting from students’ use of learning technology can produce reliable and valid estimates of individual student learning rates. Further, we sought to interpret and understand what differentiates a student with a high estimated learning rate from a student with a low one. We found that learning rate is significantly related to estimates of student ability (prior knowledge) and self-reported measures of diligence.

conference,Cook2017186,"BKT and other classical student models are designed for binary environments where actions are either correct or incorrect. These models face limitations in open-ended and data-driven environments where actions may be correct but non-ideal or where there may even be degrees of error. In this paper we present BKTSR and RKT-SR: extensions of the existing BKT model that distinguish knowing how to apply a skill from knowing when. We compare their relative performance to that of classical BKT and PFA on data collected from Deep Thought, an open-ended propositional logic tutor. We develop basic performance curves for student outcomes to help us visually compare models predictions to data. We also introduce a new approach for finding a probability distribution of actions in ranked, multiple option environments with RKT and RKT-SR.

conference,Tato2017284,"We propose a model that employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to evaluate sociomoral reasoning maturity, a key social ability, necessary for adaptive social functioning. Our model is used in a serious game to evaluate learners. It uses pre-annotated textual data (verbatims) and a coding scheme (SoMoral) applied by experts in psychology. State of the art text classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, etc.) achieved low results in our context in contrary to the CNN that achieved best results with little fine tuning on the input data representation. We use a simple but efficient input data vectors representation learnt directly from the dataset without loosing the sentences ‘semantic’. We present a series of experiments with 5 baseline text classification algorithms and 4 baseline data representation. The results show that our model can predict the level of sociomoral reasoning with about 92% of accuracy.

conference,Kai20175,"Research on non-cognitive factors has shown that persistence in the face of challenges plays an important role in learning. However, recent work on wheel-spinning, a type of unproductive persistence where students spend too much time struggling without achieving mastery of skills, show that not all persistence is uniformly beneficial for learning. For this reason, it becomes increasingly pertinent to identify the key differences between unproductive and productive persistence toward informing interventions in computer-based learning environments. In this study, we attempt to address this by using classification models to distinguish between productive persistence and wheel-spinning in ASSISTments, an online math learning platform. Our results indicate that wheel-spinning is associated with shorter delays between solving problems of the same skill, more attempts to answer problems, and the heavy use of bottom out hints except for the first problem. These findings suggest that encouraging students to engage in spaced practice and avoid over-using bottom-out hints is likely helpful to reduce their wheel-spinning and improve learning. These findings also provide insight on which students are struggling and how to make students’ persistence more productive. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Three linear effects models were compared: (a) a baseline linear model including non-linguistic fixed effects, (b) a model including only linguistic factors, (c) a model including both linguistic and non-linguistic effects. The best model (c) explained 16% of the variance of final course scores, revealing significant effects for one non-linguistic feature (days on the system) and two linguistic features (Number of dependents per prepositional object nominal and Sentence linking connectives). One non-linguistic factor (Is a peer tutor) and two linguistic variables (Words related to self and Words related to tool use) demonstrated marginal significance. The findings indicate that language proficiency is strongly linked to math performance such that more complex syntactic structures and fewer explicit cohesion devices equate to higher course performance. The linguistic model also indicated that less self-centered students and students using words related to tool use were more successful. In addition, the results indicate that students that are more active in on-line discussion forums are more likely to be successful. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

OELEs provide students choice in how they go about constructing solutions to problems, and students exhibit a variety of learning behaviors in such environments. Building accurate models from limited amount of student data is difficult; to address this we develop a methodology that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search methods to boost the initial set of student action sequences in such a way that we can learn more accurate models of students’ learning behaviors. We use a HMM representation to model students’ learning behaviors and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by running a case study on data collected from 98 students, who worked with the Betty’s Brain system for four days.

conference,Rushkin2017466,"We report an experimental implementation of adaptive learning functionality in a self-paced HarvardX MOOC (massive open online course). In MOOCs there is need for evidence-based instructional designs that create the optimal conditions for learners, who come to the course with widely differing prior knowledge, skills and motivations. But users in such a course are free to explore the course materials in any order they deem fit and may drop out any time, and this makes it hard to predict the practical challenges of implementing adaptivity, as well as its effect, without experimentation. This study explored the technological feasibility and implications of adaptive functionality to course (re)design in the edX platform. Additionally, it aimed to establish the foundation for future study of adaptive functionality in MOOCs on learning outcomes, engagement and drop-out rates. Our preliminary findings suggest that the adaptivity of the kind we used leads to a higher efficiency of learning (without an adverse effect on learning outcomes, learners go through the course faster and attempt fewer problems, since the problems are served to them in a targeted way). Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore additional possible effects. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Further, we demonstrate on two independent data sets that our method outperforms previous methods for finding efficient feature embeddings and generalizes better to imbalanced data sets compared to expert features.

conference,Ishola2017238,"Question and answer forums are becoming more popular as increasing numbers of lifelong learners rely on such forums to receive help about their learning needs. Stack Overflow (SO) is an example of such a forum used by millions of programmers. The ability of users to receive timely answers to questions is crucial to the sustainability of such forums and for successful lifelong learning. In SO we have observed that the number of questions answered within 15 minutes have diminished with more questions taking a longer time to get answered or remaining unanswered in some cases. This suggests the need for an effective approach in predicting prospective helpers who can provide timely answers to the questions. In this paper, we seek to explore strategies to match helpers and help seekers. In particular we wish to use these strategies to predict which SO users will provide timely answers to questions asked in SO, and then compare these predictions to the users who actually answered the questions. In making these predictions we looked at 3 time frames of user data: 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. We used 5 basic strategies: frequency, knowledgeability, eagerness, willingness, recency; and we compared the success rates of each strategy in making predictions on 3 different success criteria: predicting the first answerer, predicting the answerer most liked by the asker of the question, and predicting the answerer rated most highly by other SO users. We then incorporated a timeliness measure, which takes into consideration how quickly the user provides answers to questions in the past, which helped us to achieve a higher success rate. The results of our study are an improvement over a similar previous study of SO and we hope will form the basis of methods for recommending peers in online forums who can provide just-in-time help to lifelong learners as their knowledge needs evolve and change. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Shen2017266,"One of the most challenging tasks in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM) is to cluster students directly based on system-student sequential moment-to-moment interactive trajectories. The objective of this study is to build a general temporal clustering framework that captures the distinct characteristics of students’ sequential behaviors patterns, that tracks whether a student’s learning experience is unprofitable, and can identify such an individual as early as possible so personalized learning can be offered. The central idea of our framework is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which calculates distance between any two temporal sequences even with different lengths. In this paper, we explore both the original DTW and our proposed normalized DTW to generate distance matrix and apply Hierarchical Clustering to the resulted distance matrix. To fully evaluate the power of our temporal sequential clustering framework, we calculate distance matrix at three types of granularity in the increasing order of: problem, level, and session across three training datasets. As expected, results show that clustering moment-to-moment temporal sequences at problem granularity is more effective than level and session granularity. In addition, our proposed normalized DTW is more effective than both original DTW and the baseline Euclidean distance. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Liu201740,"Replayability has long been touted as a benefit of educational games. However, little research has measured its impact on learning, or investigated when students choose to replay prior content. In this study, we analyzed data on a sample of 4,827 3rd-5th graders from ST Math, a game-based educational platform integrated into classroom instruction in over 3,000 classrooms across the U.S. We identified features that describe elective replays relative to prior gameplay performance, and associated elective replays with in-game accuracy, confidence, and general math ability assessments outside of the games. We found some elective replay patterns were associated with learning, whereas others indicated that students were struggling in the current educational content. We suggest, therefore, that educational games should use elective replay behaviors to target interventions according to when and whether replay is helpful for learning. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

In this paper, we utilize discourse data mining as the foundation for an online team-formation procedure. The procedure features a deliberation process prior to team assignment, where participants hold discussions both to prepare for the collaboration task and provide indicators that are then used during automated team assignment. We automatically assign teams in a way that maximizes average observed pairwise transactivity exchange within teams, whereas in a control condition, teams are assigned randomly. We validate our team-formation procedure in a crowdsourced online environment that enables effective isolation of variables, namely Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.

Students used the ASSISTments platform to do their homework for a school year. Our results suggested no significant difference between the time the two genders spent on homework overall. There was a marginally significant difference on homework time between genders in the high performing group only.

conference,Lamb2016601,"We examine algorithms for creating indexes into ordered series of instructional lecture video transcripts. The goal is for students and industry practitioners to use the indexes towards review or reference. Lecture videos differ from often-examined document collections such as newspaper articles in that the transcript ordering generally reflects pedagogical intent. One challenge is therefore to identify where a concept is primarily introduced, and where the resulting index should thus direct students. The typically applied TF-IDF approach gets tricked in this context by artifacts such as worked examples whose associated vocabulary may dominate a lecture, but should not be included in a good index. We contrast the TF-IDF approach with algorithms that consult Wikipedia documents to vouch for term importance. This method helps filter the harmful artifacts. We measure the algorithms against three human-created indexes over the 90 lecture videos of a popular database course. We found that (i) humans have low inter-rater reliability, whether they are experts in the field or not, and that (ii) one of the examined algorithms approaches the inter-rater reliability with humans. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Botelho2016292,"The incorporation of prerequisite skill structures into educational systems helps to identify the order in which concepts should be presented to students to optimize student achievement. Many skills have a causal relationship in which one skill must be presented before another, indicating a strong skill relationship. Knowing this relationship can help to predict student performance and identify prerequisite arches. Skill relationships, however, are not directly measurable; instead, the relationship can be estimated by observing differences of student performance across skills. Such methods of estimation, however, seem to lack a baseline model to compare their effectiveness. If two methods of estimating the existence of a relationship yield two different values, which is the more accurate result? In this work, we propose a method of comparing models that attempt to measure the strength of skill relationships. With this method, we begin to identify those student-level covariates that provide the most accurate models predicting the existence of skill relationships. Focusing on interactions of performance across skills, we use our method to construct models to predict the existence of five strongly-related and five simulated poorly-related skill pairs. Our method is able to evaluate several models that distinguish these differences with significant accuracy gains over a null model, and provides the means to identify that interactions of student mastery provide the most significant contributions to these gains in our analysis. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Shen2016507,"We explored a series of feature selection methods for model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). More specifically, we explored four common correlation metrics and based on them, we proposed the fifth one named Weighed Information Gain (WIG). While much existing correlation-based feature selection methods mostly explored high correlation by default, we explored two options: High vs. Low. The former selects the next feature that has the highest correlation measure with existing selected ones while the latter selects the one with the lowest correlations. The 10 correlation-based methods were compared against previous feature selection methods for model-based RL across several datasets collected from two vastly different intelligent tutoring systems. Our results showed that the 10 correlation-based methods significantly outperform all other methods across all datasets. Among the five correlation metrics, WIG performed best. Surprisingly, for each of correlation metrics, the low option significantly outperform its high correlation peer and thus it suggests that low correlation-based feature selection methods are more effective for model-based RL than high ones. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Mojarad2016701,"Teachers and instructors assign students homework of varying lengths. There is considerable evidence that factors such as cognitive load play a role in student performance and learning, but there has not been sufficient study of how these phenomena play out in the specific case of the length of homework. In this paper, we study the impact of assignment size on student performance. This paper represents the first attempt we are aware of to study how long assignments should be, in real-world data, in order to maximize student performance and learning. However, natural assignments of different lengths often vary in other ways. We control for this limitation using propensity score matching (PSM), an approach that helps to control for variables affecting outcome besides the intervention of interest. As such, we can conduct our analysis on large-scale data naturalistically collected through a digital educational platform. We use PSM to study the effect of assignment size on student performance while controlling for assignment difficulty, discrimination and reliability. We find that shorter assignments result in higher performance. These results can be used as a guideline for instructors and instructional designers when designing course assignments. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Penteado2016675,"Learning sequences are important aspects in learning environments. Students should learn by moving gradually from simpler to more complex concepts, promoting deeper levels of learning. This feature is usually embedded in most intelligent learning environments to guide the student in the study of subject matter. The organization of this knowledge structure is usually an intensive effort of human experts, in creating a logical ordering of what is to be taught - determining the concepts and the prerequisite relations among them. In recent years, some methods have been developed for dealing with this knowledge structuring using data coming from logs of learning environments, applying data mining techniques to discover prerequisite rules and create directed graphs of prerequisites. These methods model both assessment items and skills underlying those items. The automatic methods developed so far present a semantic gap between the probabilistic analysis and the expert knowledge, sometimes causing confusion with the results. This research aims to bridge this gap by adding a minimal layer of semantic information to help in the data mining process. As an application, we intend to analyze large-scale assessment datasets, considering its specificities, and evaluate if those hybrid models can improve the prediction of item success. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Rowe2016490,"Building on prior work visualizing player behavior using interaction networks [1], we examined whether measures of implicit science learning collected during gameplay were significantly related to changes in external pre-post assessments of the same constructs. As part of a national implementation study, we collected data from 329 high school students playing an optics puzzle game, Quantum Spectre, and modeled their gameplay as an interaction network, examining errors hypothesized to be related to a lack of implicit understanding of the science concepts embedded in the game. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) showed a negative relationship between the science errors identified during gameplay and implicit science learning. These results suggest Quantum Spectre gameplay behaviors are valid assessments of implicit science learning.

conference,Nam2016672,"In many studies, engagement has been considered as an important aspect of effective learning. Retaining student engagement is thus an important goal in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). My current studies with collaborators on Dynamic Support of Contextual Vocabulary Acquisition for Reading (DSCoVAR) include building prediction models for students’ off-task behaviors. By extracting linguistically meaningful features and historical context information from interaction log data, these studies illustrate how some types of off-task behavior can be modeled from behavioral logs. The results of this research contribute to existing studies by providing examples of how to extract behavioral measures and predict off-task behaviors within a vocabulary learning system. Identifying off-task behaviors can improve students’ learning by providing personalized learning materials: for example, off-task behavior classifiers can be used to achieve more accurate predictions of the student’s vocabulary mastery level, which in turn can improve the system’s adaptive performance. Toward our goal of developing highly effective personalized vocabulary learning systems, this research would benefit from expert feedback on issues that include: principled approaches for adaptive assessment and feedback in a vocabulary learning system; and alternative methods for defining and generating off-task labels. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Mills201630,"Mind wandering (MW) reflects a shift in attention from task-related to task-unrelated thoughts. It is negatively related to performance across a range of tasks, suggesting the importance of detecting and responding to MW in real-time. Currently, there is a paucity of research on MW detection in contexts other than reading. We addressed this gap by using eye gaze to automatically detect MW during narrative film comprehension, an activity that is used across a range of learning environments. In the current study, students self-reported MW as they watched a 32.5-minute commercial film. Students’ eye gaze was recorded with an eye tracker. Supervised machine learning models were used to detect MW using global (content-independent), local (content-dependent), and combined global+local features. We achieved a student-independent score (MW F1) of .45, which reflected a 29% improvement over a chance baseline. Models built using local features were more accurate than the global and combined models. An analysis of diagnostic features revealed that MW primarily manifested as a breakdown in attentional synchrony between eye gaze and visually salient areas of the screen. We consider limitations, applications, and refinements of the MW detector. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

In this paper, we present two different approaches solving this task. Both approaches are validated on 138 courses which were offered to students of the Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University between the years of 2010 and 2013. The first approach is based on classification and regression algorithms that search for patterns in study-related data and also data about students' social behavior. We prove that students′ social behavior characteristics improve prediction for a quarter of courses. The second approach is based on collaborative filtering techniques. We predict the final grades based on previous achievements of similar students. The results show that both approaches reached similar average results and can be beneficially utilized for student final grade prediction. The first approach reaches significantly better results for courses with a small number of students. In contrary, the second approach achieves significantly better results for mathematical courses. We also identified groups of courses for which we are not able to predict the grades reliably. Finally, we are able to correctly identify half of all failures (that constitute less than a quarter of all grades) and predict the final grades only with the error of one degree in the grade scale. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Min2016454,"Recent years have seen a growing interest in intelligent game-based learning environments featuring virtual agents. A key challenge posed by incorporating virtual agents in game-based learning environments is dynamically determining the dialogue moves they should make in order to best support students’ problem solving. This paper presents a data-driven modeling approach that uses a Wizard-of-Oz framework to predict human wizards’ dialogue acts based on a sequence of multimodal data streams of student interactions with a game-based learning environment. To effectively deal with multiple, parallel sequential data streams, this paper investigates two sequence-labeling techniques: long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and conditional random fields. We train predictive models utilizing data corpora collected from two Wizard-of-Oz experiments in which a human wizard played the role of the virtual agent unbeknownst to the student. Empirical results suggest that LSTMs that utilize game trace logs and facial action units achieve the highest predictive accuracy.

conference,Rau2016478,"To succeed in STEM, students need to connect visual representations to domain-relevant concepts, which is a difficult task for them. Prior research shows that physical representations (that students manipulate with their hands) and virtual representations (that they manipulate on a computer) have complementary advantages for conceptual learning. Further, physical and virtual representations are often embedded into different social classroom practices. Thus, to optimally combine these representation modes, we need to understand what social events prompt students to connect representations to concepts, and if different representation modes afford different social prompts. A multiple-case study with 12 high-school students addresses this question. Student pairs worked with physical and virtual representations of chemistry. Frequent patterns obtained from discourse data show that students incrementally co-construct concept-representation connections, and that instructor prompts are key triggers of these connections for both representation modes. Meta-cognitive statements serve as important prompts in the absence of an instructor when students work with virtual representations. I discuss implications for interventions that combine physical and virtual representations. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Feild2016688,"In this paper, we describe a scalable learning analytics platform which runs generalized analytics models on educational data in parallel. As a proof of concept, we use this platform as a base for an end-to-end automated writing feedback system. The system allows students to view feedback on their writing in near real-time, edit their writing based on the feedback provided, and observe the progression of their performance over time. Providing students with detailed feedback is an important part of improving writing skills and an essential component towards solving Bloom’s “two sigma” problem in education. We evaluate our feedback system in two ways. First, we evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback for students with an ongoing pilot study with eight hundred students who are using the learning analytics platform in a college English course. In addition, we process an existing set of graded student essays and analyze the performance feedback. Results show a correlation between feedback values and human graded scores. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

However, many teachers struggle to provide this type of feedback to large classrooms of students. This paper takes an initial step towards supporting teacher-facilitated feedback through the use of automated and user-directed topic discovery. 114 student essays were collected from a local underperforming middle school as part of a pilot study for Write Local, a digital repository and workspace for authentic problem-based learning activities. Predictive models were built and evaluated to explore the impact of different topic discovery approaches as well as correction of student spelling errors on model accuracy.

conference,vandeSande2016523,"Learning curves have proven to be a useful tool for understanding how a student learns a given skill as they progress through a curriculum. A learning curve for a given Knowledge Component (KC) is a plot of some measure of competence as a function of the number of opportunities the student has had to apply that KC. Consider the case where each problem-solving step is recorded by, for instance, by an intelligent tutoring system. In this case, one normally assigns a unique KC to each problem-solving step and the construction of the associated learning curves is straightforward. On the other hand, many online homework systems only evaluate the student’s final answer to a problem. In that case, the student has generally applied a number of KCs to find the answer and their performance on the problem is some composite of their mastery of all of the requisite KCs. In this paper, we propose a simple method for generating learning curves for multiple-KC problems that is independent of any particular theory of learning. In the case where there is only one KC per problem, the method reduces to the ordinary learning curves. We demonstrate this method using a set of artificially generated student data. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

However, it is still unclear how well this picture generalizes to other contexts and subject areas. A corpus of 62,000 exercises for 10 textbooks on the Mastering platform has been tagged by content experts. In this report, I introduce a strategy for investigating the importance of a given set of KCs in describing student performance as the students solve problems. The strategy is to see how much of the student’s performance on an exercise is explained by the associated KC and how much it is predicted by a problem-specific difficulty parameter. To do this, I introduce a model that is a combination of the Rasch model and the learning curves from the KC picture. For this corpus and set of KC tags, a rather striking picture emerges: problem difficulty accounts for most of the student behavior while KC learning accounts for only a small portion of the student behavior. I hypothesize that these KC tags do not accurately capture the skills students are using while doing their homework. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

The result is often high attrition rates and poor performance in higher education. Based on the studies done in other countries, and by the author of this paper through online questionnaires distributed to university students and graduates in Herat, Afghanistan – it was found that proper procedures and specialized studies in high schools can help students in selecting their field of study more systematically. Additionally, there are large amounts of data available for mining purposes but the methods that the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Higher Education use to store and produce their data only enable them to achieve simple facts and figures. Furthermore, from the results it can be concluded that there are potential opportunities for educational data mining application in the domain of Afghanistan's education systems.

Further, anecdotal evidence suggests school- and district-level leaders are unaware of these realities. This suggests a vast amount of resources are being unknowingly squandered or misallocated.

conference,Rau2016199,"To succeed in STEM, students need to learn to use visual representations. Most prior research has focused on conceptual knowledge about visual representations that is acquired via verbally mediated forms of learning. However, students also need perceptual fluency: the ability to rapidly and effortlessly translate among representations. Perceptual fluency is acquired via nonverbal, implicit learning processes. A challenge for instructional interventions that focus on implicit learning is to model students’ knowledge acquisition. Because implicit learning is non-verbal, we cannot rely on traditional methods, such as expert interviews or student think-alouds. This paper uses similarity learning, a machine learning method that can assess how people perceive similarity between visual representations. We used this approach to model how undergraduate students perceive similarity between visual representations of chemical molecules. The approach achieved good accuracy in predicting students’ similarity judgments and expands expert predictions of how students might perceive visual representations of molecules. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Ma2016135,"Time has become a standard feature used in EDM models, and is used in models of meta-cognitive strategies to models of disengagement. Most of these models consider whether a student action is “too fast” or “too slow”. However, an open question remains on how we define and select these cut-offs. Moreover, it is not clear that the same cut-offs are appropriate across different situations. Some students may generally respond faster than others; more difficult items may take different amounts of time. In this paper, we consider whether absolute or relative indicators of time are more appropriate as cut-offs, and whether simple transformations (such as log time) are useful when representing time.

conference,Yudelson2016556,"Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) models were in active use in the Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) field for over 20 years. They have been intensively studied, and a number of useful extensions to them were proposed and experimentally tested. Among the most widely researched extensions to BKT models are various types of individualization. Individualization, broadly defined, is a way to account for variability in students that are working with the ITS that uses BKT model to represent and track student learning. One of the approaches to individualizing BKT is to split its parameters into per-skill and per-student components. In this work, we are proposing an approach to individualizing BKT that is based on Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBM) and, in addition to capturing student-level variability in the data, weighs the contribution of per-student and per-skill effects to the overall variance in the data. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Ritter2016626,"We envision next generation learners having access to both automated and human sources of instruction in a variety of learning contexts. In such contexts, it will be most effective if students can be assisted to appropriately navigate between these sources of instruction. For example, human tutors, when helping a struggling student, might benefit from having access to the learning profile an automated tutor possesses on the student, including what the student already knows, detected misconceptions, inferred affective state and details about the student's work with the automated system before requesting human help. Similarly, an automated tutoring system would benefit from knowledge of interactions during human tutoring session. To facilitate student transitions between these types of systems, we need to understand the factors that best aid students in transitioning between such systems. This poster reports preliminary analyses, suggesting that students who are struggling with the course are more likely to take advantage of the optional human tutoring support and that such use is associated with increased course completion rates, regardless of the student’s level of preparation. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Matsuda2016607,"We have developed a wheel spinning detector for cognitive tutors that uses a simplified method compared to existing wheel spinning detectors. The detector reads a sequence of the correctness of applying particular skill performed by a student using the cognitive tutor. The response sequence is first fed to Bayesian knowledge tracing to compute a sequence of probability of mastery at each time a skill was applied. The detector uses a neural-network model to make a binary classification for a response sequence into wheel-spinning and none-wheel spinning. To test the accuracy of the detector, we validated the detector using learning interaction data taken from a school study where students used a Geometry cognitive tutor. Human coders manually tagged the data to identify wheel spinning. The results show that the neural-network based detector has high recall (0.79) but relatively low precision (0.25) when combined with Bayesian knowledge tracing that detects mastery cases. The result suggests that the neural-network based detector is practical and has a potential for scalable use such as adaptive online course where cognitive tutors are embedded into online courseware. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Jo2016400,"An important research problem for Educational Data Mining is to expedite the cycle of data leading to the analysis of student learning processes and the improvement of support for those processes. For this goal in the context of social interaction in learning, we propose a three-part pipeline that includes data infrastructure, learning process analysis with behavior modeling, and intervention for support. We also describe an application of the pipeline to data from a social learning platform to investigate appropriate goal-setting behavior as a qualification of role models. Students following appropriate goal setters persisted longer in the course, showed increased engagement in hands-on course activities, and were more likely to review previously covered materials as they continued through the course. To foster this beneficial social interaction among students, we propose a social recommender system and show potential for assisting students in interacting with qualified goal setters as role models. We discuss how this generalizable pipeline can be adapted for other support needs in online learning settings. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

By characterizing learner strategies through patterns in their data, we can evaluate which strategies (or measures of them) are predictive of learning outcomes. We investigated strategies such as page re-reading (active reading) and video watching in response to an incorrect attempt (active watching) and found that they add predictive power beyond mere counts of the amount of doing, reading, and watching. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Tissenbaum2016517,"Research has shown that supporting tinkering and exploration promotes a wide range of STEM related literacies. However, the open-endedness of tinkering environments makes it difficult to know whether learners’ exploration is productive or not. This is especially true in museum spaces, where dwell times are short and facilitators lack a history of engagement with individual visitors. In response, this study uses telemetry data from Oztoc – an open-ended exploratory tabletop exhibit in which visitors embody the roles of engineers who are tasked with attracting and cataloging newly discovered aquatic creatures by building working electronic circuits. This data is used to build Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to devise an automated scheme of identifying when a visitor is behaving productively or unproductively. Evaluation of our HMM was shown to effectively discern when visitors were productively and unproductively engaging with the exhibit. Using a Markov model, we identify common patterns of visitor movement from unproductive to productive states to shed light on how visitors struggle and the moves they made to overcome these struggles. These findings offer considerable promise for understanding how learners productively and unproductively persevere in open-ended exploratory environments and the potential for developing real time supports to help facilitators know how and when to best engage with visitors. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

First, we found that large grading errors are generally more closely correlated with hard-to-grade submission, rather than with imprecise students. Second, we detected a weak correlation between review accuracy and student proficiency, as measured by the quality of the student’s own work. Third, we found little correlation between review accuracy and the time it took to perform the review, or how late in the review period the review was performed. Finally, we found a clear evidence of tit-for-tat behavior when students give feedback on the reviews they received.

conference,Paaßen2016183,"The first intelligent tutoring systems for computer programming have been proposed more than 30 years ago, mostly focusing on well defined programming tasks e.g. in the context of logic programming. Recent systems also teach complex programs, where explicit modelling of every possible program and mistake is no longer possible. Such systems are based on data-driven approaches, which focus on the syntax of a program or consider the output for example cases. However, the system’s understanding of student programs could be enriched by a deeper focus on the actual execution of a program. This requires a suitable data representation which encodes information of programming style as well as its functionality in a suitable way, thus offering entry points for automated feedback generation. In this contribution we propose a representation of computer programs via execution traces for example input and demonstrate the power of this representation in three key challenges for intelligent tutoring systems: identifying the underlying solution strategy, identifying erroneous solutions and locating the errors in erroneous programs for feedback display. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Malkiewich2016448,"Educational games have become hugely popular, and educational data mining has been used to predict student performance in the context of these games. However, models built on student behavior in educational games rarely differentiate between the types of problem solving that students employ and fail to address how efficacious student problem solutions are in game environments. Furthermore, few papers assess how the features selected for classification models inform an understanding of how student behaviors predict student performance. In this paper, we discuss the creation and consideration of two models that predict if a student will develop an elegant problem solution (the Gold model), or a non-optimal but workable solution (the Silver model), in the context of an educational game. A pre-determined set of features were systematically tested and fit into one or both of these models. The two models were then examined to understand how the selected features elucidate our understanding of student problem solving at varying levels of sophistication. Results suggest that while gaming the system and lack of persistence indicate non-optimal completion of a problem, gaining experience with a problem predicts more elegant problem solving. Results also suggest that general student behaviors are better predictors of student performance than level-specific behaviors. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Hicks201678,"Level creation is a creative game-play exercise that resembles problem-posing, and has shown to be engaging and helpful for players to learn about the game’s core mechanic. However, in user-authoring environments, users often create levels without considering the game’s objective, or with entirely different objectives in mind, resulting in levels which fail to afford the core gameplay mechanic. This poses a bigger threat to educational games, because the core gameplay is aligned with the learning objectives. Therefore, such levels fail to provide any opportunity for players to practice the skills the game is designed to teach. To address this problem, we designed and compared three versions of level creators in a programming game – Freeform, Programming, and Building-Block. Our results show that a simple-to-use building-block editor can guarantee levels that contain some affordances, but an editor designed to use the same core mechanic as gameplay results in the highest-quality levels. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

The models were trained and validated independently of the teacher to ensure generalization to new teachers.

conference,Baikadi2016569,"To advance our understanding of learning in massive open online courses (MOOCs), we need to understand how learners interact with course resources. Prior explorations of learner interactions with MOOC materials have often described these interactions through stereotypes, which does not account for the full spectrum of potential learner activities. A focus on stereotypes also limits our ability to explore the reasons behind learner behaviors. To overcome these shortcomings, we apply factor analysis to learner activities within four MOOCs to identify emergent behavior factors. The factors support characterizations of learner behaviors as driven heavily by types of learning activities and secondarily by time/topic; regression revealed demographic factors (especially country and gender) associated with these activity and topic preferences. Both factor and regression analyses revealed structural variability in learner activity patterns across MOOCs. The results call for a reconceptualization of how different learning activities within a MOOC are designed to work together. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

However, the explicit and implicit coupled interactions, which means the correlations between user attributes generated from learning actions, are not considered in these algorithms. Much significant and useful information which can positively affect clustering accuracy is neglected. To solve the above issue, we proposed a coupled user clustering algorithm for Wed-based learning systems. It respectively takes into account intra-coupled and inter-coupled relationships of learning data, and utilizes Taylor-like expansion to represent their integrated coupling correlations.

conference,Li2016605,"Previous studies about engagement in MOOCs has focused primarily on behavioral engagement and less attention has been paid to cognitive engagement. This may lead to incomplete or even incorrect understandings about students experience and learning in MOOCs. In this study, we use number of lectures watched as a proxy for behavioral engagement and number of pauses in lectures watched as a proxy for cognitive engagement. Results show that a large proportion of students who were behaviorally engaged (watching lectures) were not cognitively engaged—they almost never paused the lectures or they paused fewer and fewer times as the course went on. This may indicate that being behaviorally engaged does not necessarily mean being cognitively engaged. In addition, we also found that students’ number of pauses in lectures is positively associated with achievement and improves the prediction of achievement. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

We compare a family of IRT-based proficiency estimation methods to Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a recently proposed recurrent neural network model with promising initial results. We evaluate how well each model predicts a student’s future response given previous responses using two publicly available and one proprietary data set. We find that IRT-based methods consistently matched or outperformed DKT across all data sets at the finest level of content granularity that was tractable for them to be trained on. A hierarchical extension of IRT that captured item grouping structure performed best overall. When data sets included non-trivial autocorrelations in student response patterns, a temporal extension of IRT improved performance over standard IRT while the RNN-based method did not. We conclude that IRT-based models provide a simpler, better-performing alternative to existing RNN-based models of student interaction data while also affording more interpretability and guarantees due to their formulation as Bayesian probabilistic models. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Even with the availability of data from several tutoring systems, it is never possible to have a highly accurate student model or one that is tuned for each particular student. We study what is the impact of the quality of the student model on the final results obtained with the two algorithms. Our hypothesis is that the higher flexibility of multi-armed bandits in terms of the complexity and precision of the student model will compensate for the lack of longer term planning featured in POMDPs.

conference,al-Rifaie2016264,"This paper proposes a new technique for analysing the behaviour of students on an online course. This work considers a range of social learning behaviours supported in our recently designed and implemented collaborative learning system which supports students giving and receiving feedback on each other’s developing work and practice. The course was delivered to several thousand students on Coursera during which students were directed onto our social learning environment to take part in group work and assessment activities. This work introduces a swarm intelligence technique, Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS), and shows how it can be adapted and applied to our data in order to perform classification tasks. The novelty of the approach is not only in using this technique, but also applying it to data linked to social behaviour (i.e. how students interact with each other) which differentiates the work apart from many clickstream analysis studies. This paper investigates what combined activity is the best predictor of success or failure in the course. The aim is to argues that the results obtained using the proposed approach indicate the promising potential of predicting students performance through applying swarm intelligence technique to social behaviours. This work has a number of potential benefits including designing better social learning systems, designing more effective social learning and assessment exercises, and encouraging disengaged students. In addition, this work is an important step in addressing our long term goal of evidencing how critical student learning takes place as they give and receive feedback to and from each other on work in progress. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Chen201638,"Solving challenging math problems often invites a child to ride an “emotional roller-coaster” and experience a complex mixture of emotions including confusion, frustration, joy, and surprise. Early exposure to this type of “hard fun” may stimulate child’s interest and curiosity of mathematics and nurture life long skills such as resilience and perseverance. However, without optimal support, it may also turn off child prematurely due to unresolved frustration. An ideal teacher is able to pick up child’s subtle emotional signals in real time and respond optimally to offer cognitive and emotional support. In order to design an intelligent tutor specifically designed for this purpose, it is necessary to understand at fine-grained level the child’s emotion experience and its interplay with the inter-personal communication dynamics between child and his/her teacher. In this study, we made such an attempt by analyzing a series of video recordings of problem solving sessions by a young student and his mom, the ideal teacher. We demonstrate a multimodal analysis framework to characterize several aspects of the child-mom interaction patterns within the emotional context at a granular level. We then build machine learning models to predict teacher’s response using extracted multimodal features. In addition, we validate the performance of automatic detector of affect, intent-to-connect behavior, and voice activity, using annotated data, which provides evidence of the potential utility of the presented tools in scaling up analysis of this type to large number of subjects and in implementing tools to guide teachers towards optimal interactions in real time. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Using the Apprentice Learner architecture, a computational theory of learning capable of simulating human behavior in interactive learning environments, we generate two models that embody alternative theories of human learning: (1) that humans perfectly recall previous training during learning and (2) that humans only recall a limited window of experience. We evaluate which of these models is better supported by data from two fractions tutoring systems. In general, we find that the model with a complete memory better fits the data than a model recalling only the previous training experience (data-drive theory development). Additionally, we demonstrate that both models are able to predict student performances, as well as, reproduce the main effects of an experimental paradigm without being trained on student data (theory-driven prediction).

conference,Gelman2016376,"Recent studies of MOOCs demonstrate their ability to reach a large number of users, but also caution against the high rate of dropout. Some have looked closely at MOOC participation in order to better understand how and when users start to disengage, and, if they remain engaged, in what activities they participate. Most of this prior work relies heavily on descriptive statistics or clustering methodologies to highlight basic user participation characteristics. In this paper, we adapt NMF to provide a multi-dimensional view of user participation. We use log data to create a bottom-up understanding of user participation, and identify five basic behaviors associated with participants’ use of content and their engagement with assessment. Furthermore, we do a cross-course analysis across four courses and find that these five behaviors are present in all courses. Interestingly, users’ participation patterns - how they engage in these five behaviors - vary across courses even when the course topics are similar. Our methodology can be applied to other data sets, and findings from this work can assist in interventions to help users successfully accomplish their learning goals. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Rafferty2016472,"An increasing number of automated models can make inferences about learners’ understanding based on their problem solving choices in interactive educational technologies. One potential use of these models is to personalize feedback interventions. We investigate using the output of an inverse planning model to choose feedback activities for learners. The inverse planning model uses the patterns of how a learner solves algebraic equations to estimate her proficiency on several discrete skills. The personalized feedback then focuses on the skill which is least proficient and includes a combination of existing educational content and scaffolded practice. We experimentally tested the effectiveness of personalizing the feedback based on the algorithm’s estimate compared to simply providing a random feedback activity. The results show that completing the feedback was associated with performance improvements from pre- to post-test, but that personalized feedback was not associated with reliably more improvement. However, participants who received feedback about a skill that was far from mastery did show reliably more improvement than those who received feedback about an already-mastered skill. This suggests that there is potential in using the inverse planning algorithm to provide more effective learning experiences. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Maass2016143,"This research combines work in memory, retrieval practice, and depth of processing research. This work aims to identify how the format and depth of a retrieval practice item can be manipulated to increase the effort required to successfully recall or formulate an answer, with the hypothesis that if the effort required to answer an item is increased there will be more benefit to learning. This hypothesis stems from work on desirable difficulties and the effortful retrieval hypothesis. Our data source was an experiment that used a 2 (question depth: factual, applied) x 2 (answer format: multiple choice, short answer) between-subjects design to investigate the effects of these conditions on retrieval practice performance. The experiment was delivered online though Mechanical Turk (n = 178). A logistic regression predicting performance during practice indicates that participants get more (in terms of an increase in future predicted success) from successful retrievals of items that fall within the more difficult level of both the format and depth factors (i.e., short answer and applied). There is also some support that the benefit from multiple choice items may be increased by asking deeper, more applied questions.

conference,Sales2016207,"The Cognitive Tutor Algebra I (CTAI) curriculum, which includes both textbook and online components, has been shown to boost student learning by about 0.2 standard deviations in a randomized effectiveness trial. Students who were assigned to the experimental condition varied substantially in how, and how much, the used the online component of CTAI, but original analyses of the experimental data focused on estimating average effects, and did not examine whether the CTAI treatment effect varied by the amount of style of usage. This study leverages log data from the experiment to present a more nuanced analysis. It uses the framework of Principal Stratification, which estimates the varying CTAI treatment effect as a function of “potential” usage—either how students used the program, or how they would have used it had they been assigned to the treatment condition. With experimental data, Principal Stratification does not require that we assume that all relevant variables have been measured. With this framework, we find that students who receive a medium amount of assistance from the software (in the form of hints and error feedback) experience the largest effects, with lower effects for students who receive a lot or a little; and evidence that students who do not follow the curriculum order experience smaller treatment effects. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Thus, it is necessary to develop an automatic learning judgment system. In this study, we designed and developed a minimum learning judgment system that assesses minimal learning using a word game performance measure. In the system, a student watches a video containing educational content and is subsequently tested on information retention by playing a word game that tests the student on the video content. This learning judgment system tests minimal learning of educational content without requiring significant effort from either the instructor or the student. We conducted experiments to show a performance of the system and the result shows about 95% (Passjudgment: 95.1%, Fail judgment: 94.8%) performance. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Labarthe2016418,"Overall the social capital of MOOCs is under-exploited. For most students in MOOCs, autonomous learning often means learning alone. Students interested in adding a social dimension to their learning can browse discussion threads, join social medias and may message other students but usually in a blind and somehow random way, only hoping to find someone relevant, available and also willing to interact. This common isolation might be a contributing factor on student attrition rate and on their general learning experience. To foster learners’ persistence in MOOCs, we propose to enhance the MOOC experience with a recommender which provides each student with an individual list of rich-potential contacts, created in real-time on the basis of their own profile and activities. This paper describes a controlled study conducted from Sept. to Nov. 2015 during a MOOC on Project Management. A recommender panel was integrated to the experimental users’ interface and allowed them to manage contacts, send them an instant message or consult their profile. The population (N = 8,673) was randomly split into two: a control group, without any recommendations, and an experimental group in which students could choose to activate and use the recommender. After having demonstrated that these populations were similar up to the activation of the recommender, we evaluate the effect of the recommender on the basis of four factors of learners’ persistence: attendance, completion, success and participation. Results show the recommender improved all these 4 factors: students were much more likely to persist and engage in the MOOC if they received recommendations than if they did not. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Xiong2016545,"Over the last couple of decades, there have been a large variety of approaches towards modeling student knowledge within intelligent tutoring systems. With the booming development of deep learning and large-scale artificial neural networks, there have been empirical successes in a number of machine learning and data mining applications, including student knowledge modeling. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a pioneer algorithm that utilizes recurrent neural networks to model student learning, reports substantial improvements in prediction performance. To help the EDM community better understand the promising techniques of deep learning, we examine DKT alongside two well-studied models for knowledge modeling, PFA and BKT. In addition to sharing a primer on the internal computational structures of DKT, we also report on potential issues that arise from data formatting. We take steps to reproduce the experiments of Deep Knowledge Tracing by implementing a DKT algorithm using Google’s TensorFlow framework; we also reproduce similar results on new datasets. We determine that the DKT findings don't hold an overall edge when compared to the PFA model, when applied to properly prepared datasets that are limited to main (i.e. non-scaffolding) questions. More importantly, during the investigation of DKT, we not only discovered a data quality issue in a public available data set, but we also detected a vulnerability of DKT at how it handles multiple skill sequences. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

However, when faced with these appealing but overwhelming learning resources, learners are prone making rash learning decisions, which may be either excessive or insufficient to their learning capacities. To avoid the mismatch between learners and learning objects, we propose a supporting system that recommends a personalized path of learning objects for a given learner. In realizing this system, a domain knowledge structure is necessary to connect learners’ information and learning objects. As an initiative step, we employ the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation method to predict how the content of a course is distributed over different categories in the domain. We conduct experiments by utilizing course syllabi as course content, and curriculum guidelines as domain knowledge.

Too few studies have “closed the loop” by applying discovered models toward improving instruction and testing whether proposed improvements achieve higher student outcomes. We claim that such application is more effective when interpretable, explanatory models are produced. One class of such models involves a matrix mapping hypothesized (and typically human labeled) latent knowledge components (KCs) to the instructional practice tasks that require them. An under-investigated assumption in these models is that both task difficulty and learning transfer are modeled and predicted by the same latent KCs. We provide evidence for this assumption. More specifically, we investigate the data-driven hypothesis that competence with Algebra story problems may be better enhanced not through story problem practice but through, apparently task irrelevant, practice with symbolic expressions. We present new data and analytics that extend a prior close-the-loop study to 711 middle school math students. The results provide evidence that quantitative cognitive task analysis can use data from task difficulty differences to aid discovery of cognitive models that include non-obvious or hidden skills. In turn, student learning and transfer can be improved by closing the loop through instructional design of novel tasks to practice those hidden skills. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

We evaluate our algorithm on historical student data and show that it can provide hints that successfully lead students to solutions from any state, help students achieve assignment objectives, and align with the student’s future solution. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,NoAuthor2016298,"As MOOCs become a major player in modern education, questions about how to improve their effectiveness and reach are of increasing importance. If machine learning and predictive analytics techniques promise to help teachers and MOOC providers customize the learning experience for students, differences between platforms, courses and iterations pose specific challenges. In this paper, we develop a framework to define classification problems across courses, provide proof that ensembling methods allow for the development of high-performing predictive models, and show that these techniques can be used across platforms, as well as across courses. We thus build a universal framework to deploy predictive models on MOOCs and demonstrate our case on the dropout prediction problem. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Khajah201694,"In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning approach to predicting students’ performance as they work through a series of exercises—termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT—has demonstrated a stunning performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge tracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT’s advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that DKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity that BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence, inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate that when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical regularities—using extensions previously proposed in the literature—BKT achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue that while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel representations—the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not require ‘depth’; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us greater interpretability and explanatory power. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Chen201646,"Skill prerequisite information is useful for tutoring systems that assess student knowledge or that provide remediation. These systems often encode prerequisites as graphs designed by subject matter experts in a costly and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce Combined student Modeling and prerequisite Discovery (COMMAND), a novel algorithm for jointly inferring a prerequisite graph and a student model from data. Learning a COMMAND model requires student performance data and a mapping of items to skills (Q-matrix). COMMAND learns the skill prerequisite relations as a Bayesian network (an encoding of the probabilistic dependence among the skills) via a two-stage learning process. In the first stage, it uses an algorithm called Structural Expectation Maximization to select a class of equivalent Bayesian networks; in the second stage, it uses curriculum information to select a single Bayesian network. Our experiments on simulations and real student data suggest that COMMAND is better than prior methods in the literature. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Labutov2016110,"A growing subset of the web today is aimed at teaching and explaining technical concepts with varying degrees of detail and to a broad range of target audiences. Content such as tutorials, blog articles and lecture notes is becoming more prevalent in many technical disciplines and provides up-to-date technical coverage with widely different levels of prerequisite assumptions on the part of the reader. We propose a task of organizing heterogeneous educational resources on the web into a structure akin to a textbook or a course, allowing the learner to navigate a sequence of web-pages that take them from point A (their prior knowledge) to point B (material they want to learn). We approach this task by 1) performing a shallow term-level classification of what concepts are explained and assumed in any given text, and 2) using this representation to connect web resources that explain concepts to those web resources where the same concepts are assumed. The main contributions of this paper are 1) a supervised classification approach to identifying explained and assumed terms in a document and 2) an algorithm for finding optimal paths through the web resources given the constraints of the user’s goal and prior knowledge. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Holistic scores and linguistic properties of these essays were then automatically calculated using natural language processing tools. Results indicated that keystroke indices accounted for 76% of the variance in essay quality and up to 38% of the variance in the linguistic characteristics.

conference,Lan2016424,"Recent developments in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize education by providing an optimized, personalized learning experience for each student. We study the problem of selecting the best personalized learning action that each student should take next given their learning history; possible actions could include reading a textbook section, watching a lecture video, interacting with a simulation or lab, solving a practice question, and so on. We first estimate each student’s knowledge profile from their binary-valued graded responses to questions in their previous assessments using the SPARFA framework. We then employ these knowledge profiles as contexts in the contextual (multi-armed) bandits framework to learn a policy that selects the personalized learning actions that maximize each student’s immediate success, i.e., their performance on their next assessment. We develop two algorithms for personalized learning action selection. While one is mainly of theoretical interest, we experimentally validate the other using a real-world educational dataset.

conference,Li2016430,"In this paper, we applied the crowdsourcing approach to develop an automated popularity summary scoring, called wild summaries. In contrast, the golden standard summaries generated by one or more experts are called expert summaries. The innovation of our study is to compute LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) similarities between target summary and wild summaries rather than expert summaries. We called this method CLSAS, i.e., crowdsourcing-based LSA similarity. We evaluated CLSAS by comparing it with other approaches, Coh-Metrix language and discourse features and LIWC psychometric word measures. Results showed that CLSAS alone could explain 19% of human summary score, which was equivalent to the variance explained by dozens of language and discourse features and/or the word features. Results also showed that adding language and/or word features to CLSAS increased small additional correlations.

conference,Liu2016436,"The increasing use of educational technologies in classrooms is producing vast amounts of process data that capture rich information about learning as it unfolds. The field of educational data mining has made great progress in using log data to build models that improve instruction and advance the science of learning. Thus far, however, the predictive and explanatory power of such models has often been limited to the actions that educational technologies can log. A major challenge in incorporating more contextually rich data streams into models of learning is collecting and integrating data from different sources and at different grain sizes. We present our methodological advances in automating the integration of log data with additional multi-modal (e.g., audio, screen video, webcam video) data streams. We also demonstrate several examples of how integrating multiple streams of data into the knowledge component (KC) model refinement process improves the predictive fit of student models and yields important pedagogical implications.

conference,Hutt201686,"Mind wandering (MW) is a ubiquitous phenomenon characterized by an unintentional shift in attention from task-related to task-unrelated thoughts. MW is frequent during learning and negatively correlates with learning outcomes. Therefore, the next generation of intelligent learning technologies should benefit from mechanisms that detect and combat MW. As an initial step in this direction, we used eye-gaze and contextual information (e.g., time into session) to build an automated MW detector as students interact with GuruTutor – an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for biology. Students self-reported MW by responding to pseudorandom thought-probes during the tutoring session while a consumer-grade eye tracker monitored their eye movements. We used supervised machine learning techniques to discriminate between positive and negative responses to the probes in a student-independent fashion. Our best results for detecting MW (F1 of 0.49) were obtained with an evolutionary approach to develop topologies for neural network classifiers. These outperformed standard classifiers (F1 of 0.43 with a Bayes net) and a chance baseline (F1 of 0.19).

When hints were available from the start, students were more likely to delay work, compared to students for whom step-wise hints were only available after the third problem. When hints were always available, participants took significantly more time to complete a mastery learning assignment. We interpret this difference in time to complete the assignment as an opportunity to re-engage in productive math learning.

As an extension to the authors’ previous work in identifying key topics from MOOC discussion contents, this work visualises lecture-related discussions as a graph of relationships between topics and threads. We demonstrate the visualisation using three popular MOOCs offered during 2013. This work facilitates the course staff to locate and navigate the most influential topic clusters as well as the discussions that require intervention by connecting the topics with the corresponding weekly lectures. Further, we demonstrate how our interactive visualisation can be used to explore correlation between discussion topics and other variables such as views, posts, votes, and instructor intervention. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Ng2016167,"During the semester break, 36 second-grade students accessed a set of resources and completed a series of online math activities focused on the application of the model method for arithmetic in two contexts 1) addition/subtraction and 2) multiplication/ division. The learning environment first modeled and then supported the use of a scripted series of steps for solving mathematical word problems. As students completed the activities, the learning environment captured their event-related data. We then used a combination of Affinity Propagation, an automated form of clustering, and sequential pattern mining to convert the activity logs into interpretable activity sequences. Analysis of the activity sequences identified distinct patterns of behavior that strongly predicted which students would transit from the familiar addition/subtraction word problem activity to the unfamiliar multiplication/division word problem activity. Students who showed the greatest and least compliance with the script were the least likely to attempt the multiplication/division activity. Students who showed more of a schematic problem solving process were more likely to continue to the multiplication/division activity. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

This study investigates whether adult participants learn more from choosing rather than receiving feedback from virtual characters in a digital poster design task. We employed a yoked study design and two versions of an online game-based assessment, Posterlet, to compare the learning outcomes of N=264 Mechanical Turk adults in two conditions: when they chose the feedback valence versus when they received the same feedback valence and order. In Posterlet, players design posters and learn graphic design principles from feedback. We found that the more the participants chose critical feedback, the more time they spent designing posters, but there were no differences in learning, revision, and time spent designing posters between conditions. In each condition, critical feedback correlated with performance and revision, suggesting that feedback valence is important for performance, regardless of being a choice. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Klingler2016102,"The extraction of student behavior is an important task in educational data mining. A common approach to detect similar behavior patterns is to cluster sequential data. Standard approaches identify clusters at each time step separately and typically show low performance for data that inherently suffer from noise, resulting in temporally inconsistent clusters. We propose an evolutionary clustering pipeline that can be applied to learning data, aiming at improving cluster stability over multiple training sessions in the presence of noise. Our model selection is designed such that relevant cluster evolution effects can be captured. The pipeline can be used as a black box for any intelligent tutoring system (ITS). We show that our method outperforms previous work regarding clustering performance and stability on synthetic data. Using log data from two ITS, we demonstrate that the proposed pipeline is able to detect interesting student behavior and properties of learning environments. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Tomkins2016239,"With the success and proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) for college curricula, there is demand for adapting this modern mode of education for high school courses. Online and open courses have the potential to fill a much needed gap in high school curricula, especially in fields such as computer science, where there is shortage of trained teachers nationwide. In this paper, we analyze student post-test performance to determine the success of a high school computer science MOOC. We empirically characterize student success by using students’ performance on the Advanced Placement (AP) exam, which we treat as a post test. This post-test performance is more indicative of long-term learning than course performance, and allows us to model the extent to which students have internalized course material. Additionally, we analyze and compare the performance of a subset of students who received in-person coaching at their high school, to those students who took the course independently. This comparison provides better understanding of the role of a teacher in a student’s learning. We build a predictive machine learning model, and use it to identify the key factors contributing to the success of online high school courses. Our analysis demonstrates that high schoolers can thrive in MOOCs. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Gomes2013,"In this paper, we describe results of a multimodal learning analytics pilot study designed to understand the differences in eye tracking patterns found to exist between students with low and high performance in three engineering-related computer games, all of which require spatial ability, problem-solving skills, and a capacity to interpret visual imagery. In the first game, gears and chains had to be properly connected so that all gears depicted on the screen would spin simultaneously. In the second game, students needed to manipulate lines so as to ensure that no two intersected. In the final game, students were asked to position gears in specific screen locations in order to put in motion onscreen objects. The literature establishes that such abilities are related to math learning and math performance. In this regard, we believe that understanding these differences in student’s visual processing, problem-solving, and the attention they dedicate to spatial stimuli will be helpful in making positive interventions in STEM education for diverse populations. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Ezen-Can2013,"Dialogue acts model the intent underlying dialogue moves. In natural language tutorial dialogue, student dialogue moves hold important information about knowledge and goals, and are therefore an integral part of providing adaptive tutoring. Automatically classifying these dialogue acts is a challenging task, traditionally addressed with supervised classification techniques requiring substantial manual time and effort. There is growing interest in unsupervised dialogue act classification to address this limitation. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework, query-likelihood clustering, for classifying student dialogue acts. This framework combines automated natural language processing with clustering and a novel adaptation of an information retrieval technique. Evaluation against manually labeled dialogue acts on a tutorial dialogue corpus in the domain of introductory computer science demonstrates that the proposed technique outperforms existing approaches. The results indicate that this technique holds promise for automatically understanding corpora of tutorial dialogue and for building adaptive dialogue systems. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Vihavainen2013,"Computer science students starting their studies at our university often fail their first mandatory mathematics course, as they are not required to have a strong background in mathematics. Failing can also be partly explained by the need to adjust to a new environment and new working practices. Here, we are looking for indicators in students’ working practices that could be used to point out students that are at risk of failing some of their courses, and could benefit from an intervention. We present initial results on how freshman students’ programming behavior in an introductory programming course can be used to predict their success in a concurrently organized introductory mathematics course. A plugin in students’ programming environment gathers snapshots (time, code changes) from students actual programming process. Gathered snapshots are transformed to data items that contain features indicating e.g. deadline-driven mentality or eagerness. Our results using Bayesian networks indicate that we can identify students with a high likelihood of failing their mathematics course already at a very early phase of their studies using only data that represents their programming behavior. © 2013 International educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Carlson2013,"We analyze log-data generated by an experiment with Fractions Tutor, an intelligent tutoring system. The experiment compares the educational effectiveness of instruction with single and multiple graphical representations. We extract the error-making and hint-seeking behaviors of each student to characterize their learning strategy. Using an expectation-maximization approach, we cluster the students by learning strategy. We find that a) experimental condition and learning outcome are clearly associated b) experimental condition and learning strategy are not, and c) almost all of the association between experimental condition and learning outcome is found among students implementing just one of the learning strategies we identify. This class of students is characterized by relatively high rates of error as well as a marked reluctance to seek help. They also show the greatest educational gains from instruction with multiple rather than single representations. The behaviors that characterize this group illuminate the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of multiple representations and suggest strategies for tailoring instruction to individual students.

conference,Lan2013,"Machine learning offers novel ways and means to design personalized learning systems wherein each student’s educational experience is customized in real time depending on their background, learning goals, and performance to date. SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) is a novel framework for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimates a learner’s knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimates the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. SPARFA jointly learns the associations among the questions and the concepts, learner concept knowledge profiles, and the underlying question difficulties, solely based on the correct/incorrect graded responses of a population of learners to a collection of questions. In this paper, we extend the SPARFA framework significantly to enable: (i) the analysis of graded responses on an ordinal scale (partial credit) rather than a binary scale (correct/incorrect); (ii) the exploitation of tags/labels for questions that partially describe the question–concept associations. The resulting Ordinal SPARFA-Tag framework greatly enhances the interpretability of the estimated concepts. We demonstrate using real educational data that Ordinal SPARFA-Tag outperforms both SPARFA and existing collaborative filtering techniques in predicting missing learner responses. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Li2013,"One of the key factors that affects automated tutoring systems in making instructional decisions is the quality of the student model built in the system. A student model is a model that can solve problems in various ways as human students. A good student model that matches with student behavior patterns often provides useful information on learning task difficulty and transfer of learning between related problems, and thus often yields better instruction on intelligent tutoring systems. However, traditional ways of constructing such models are often time consuming, and may still miss distinctions in content and learning that have important instructional implications. Automated methods can be used to find better student models, but usually require some engineering effort, and can be hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that finds student models using a clustering algorithm based on automatically-generated problem content features. We demonstrate the proposed approach using an algebra dataset. Experimental results show that the discovered model is as good as one of the best existing models, which is a model found by a previous automated approach, but without the knowledge engineering effort. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

All these metrics are designed to avoid over-fitting to the data, including AIC, BIC, and cross validation. We find that AIC is the metric most consistent with all the others and corresponds better with cross validation results than BIC. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Chaturvedi2013,Educational model for higher education has shown a drift from traditional classroom to technology-driven models that merge classroom teaching with web-based learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle and CLEW. Every teaching model has a set of supervised (e.g. quizzes) and/or unsupervised (e.g. assignments) instruments that are used to evaluate the effectiveness of learning. The challenge is in preserving student motivation in the unsupervised instruments such as assignments as they are less structured compared to quizzes and tests. The research applies association rule mining to specifically find the impact of unsupervised course work (e.g. assignments) on overall performance (e.g. exam and total marks). © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

To address these limitations, we first use a higher order Item Response Theory (IRT) model that approximates students’ initial knowledge as their one-dimensional (or low-dimensional) overall proficiency, and combines it with the estimated difficulty and discrimination of each skill to estimate the probability knew of knowing a skill before practicing it. We then fit skill-specific knowledge tracing probabilities for learn, guess, and slip. Using synthetic data, we show that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover the parameters of this Higher-Order Knowledge Tracing (HO-KT) model.

conference,Harpstead2013,"The rich interaction space of many educational games presents a challenge for designers and researchers who strive to help players achieve specific learning outcomes. Giving players a large amount of freedom over how they perform a complex game task makes it difficult to anticipate what they will do. In order to address this issue designers must ask: what are students doing in my game? And does it embody what I intended them to learn? To answer these questions, designers need methods to expose the details of student play. We describe our approach for automatic extraction of conceptual features from logs of student play sessions within an open educational game utilizing a two-dimensional context-free grammar. We demonstrate how these features can be used to cluster student solutions in the educational game RumbleBlocks. Using these clusters, we explore the range of solutions and measure how many students use the designers’ envisioned solution. Equipped with this information, designers and researchers can focus redesign efforts to areas in the game where discrepancies exist between the designers’ intentions and player experiences. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,DeeMiller2013,"Supervised learning (SL) systems have been used to automatically learn models for analysis of learning object (LO) data. However, SL systems have trouble accommodating data from multiple distributions and “troublesome” data that contains irrelevant features or noise—all of which are relatively common in highly diverse LO data. The solution is to break up the available data into separate areas and then take steps to improve models on areas containing troublesome data. Unfortunately, finding these areas in the first place is a far from trivial task that balances finding a single distribution with having sufficient data to support meaningful analysis. Therefore, we propose a BoU meta-reasoning (MR) algorithm that first uses semi-supervised clustering to find compact clusters with multiple labels that each support meaningful analyses. After clustering, our BoU MR algorithm learns a separate model on each such cluster. Finally, our BoU MR algorithm uses feature selection (FS) and noise correction (NC) algorithms to improve models on clusters containing troublesome data. Our experiments, using three datasets containing over 5000 sessions of student interactions with LOs, show that multiple models from BoU MR achieve more accurate analyses than a single model. Further, FS and NC algorithms are more effective at improving multiple models than a single model. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Adjei2013,"The field of educational data mining has been paying attention to Knowledge Tracing (KT) for a long time. Corbett and Anderson assumed the amount of learning that students do does not depend on whether students get items right or wrong. Ohlsson and others argued that the student should learn more from a previous incorrect performance. We decided to investigate a Bayes Network similar to KT but that allows us to have learning rates that are different according to whether students get items correct or not. While the idea of allowing learning rates from previous incorrect performances to be higher seems intuitive, our experiments showed that this way does not always lead to better predictions. Of course reasoning from a null result is dangerous, our contribution is that this intuitive idea is not one that other researchers should waste time in working on, unless they come up with a different model from the model we used (which is the naïve way of modifying KT). © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Goldin2013,"A student using an interactive learning environment (ILE) may take multiple attempts to solve a problem step, at times using hints. But how effective are hints? Because data mining occasionally finds implausible negative effects of hints, a method is needed to remove selection effects related to hint use. We distinguish multiple attempts in which a student repeatedly seeks hints from multiple attempts to answer the problem. Exploratory analysis of log data from a tutoring system shows that making a hint request rather on the first attempt on a problem step correlates with hint requests on subsequent attempts, and proficiency on a first attempt correlates with proficiency on subsequent attempts. Based on this, we devise a multinomial logistic regression that distinguishes hint-request tendency from proficiency. We find that seeking just one hint is associated with repeated hint-seeking, but when students do make attempts to solve a problem after viewing a hint, they succeed about half of the time. Thus, the model removes seemingly negative “effects” of hints. We also find that individual differences among students are more prominent in hint-seeking tendency than in proficiency with hints. We conclude with some ideas to improve our model. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Mostafavi2013,"When developing an intelligent tutoring system, it is necessary to have a significant number of highly varied problems that adapt to a student’s individual learning style. In developing an intelligent tutor for logic proof construction, selecting problems for individual students that effectively aid their progress can be difficult, since logic proofs require knowledge of a number of concepts and problem solving abilities. The level of variation in the problems needed to satisfy all possibilities would require an infeasible number of problems to develop. Using a proof construction tool called Deep Thought, we have developed a system which chooses existing problem sets for students using knowledge tracing of students’ accumulated application of logic proof solving concepts and are running a pilot study to determine the system’s effectiveness. Our ultimate goal is to use what is learned from this study to be able to automatically generate logic proof problems for students that fit their individual learning style, and aid in the mastery of proof construction concepts. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,SaoPedro2013,"In this paper, we incorporate scaffolding and change of tutor context within the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) framework to track students’ developing inquiry skills. These skills are demonstrated as students experiment within interactive simulations for two science topics. Our aim is twofold. First, we desire to improve the models’ predictive performance by adding these factors. Second, we aim to interpret these extended models to reveal if our scaffolding approach is effective, and if inquiry skills transfer across the topics. We found that incorporating scaffolding yielded better predictions of individual students’ performance over the classic BKT model. By interpreting our models, we found that scaffolding appears to be effective at helping students acquire these skills, and that the skills transfer across topics. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

At posttest, participants increased their ability to discern tritones from octaves, and performance was better for those who received an interleaving order of the practice trials. Data mining of the results used a novel method to capture curvilinear forgetting and spacing effects in the data and allowed a deeper analysis of the pedagogical implications of our task that revealed richer information than would have been revealed by the pretest-to-posttest comparison alone.

conference,Xiong2013,"Topic modeling is widely used for content analysis of textual documents. While the mined topic terms are considered as a semantic abstraction of the original text, few people evaluate the accuracy of humans’ interpretation of them in the context of an application based on the topic terms. Previously, we proposed RevExplore, an interactive peer-review analytic tool that supports teachers in making sense of large volumes of student peer reviews. To better evaluate the functionality of RevExplore, in this paper we take a closer look at its Natural Language Processing component which automatically compares two groups of reviews at the topic-word level. We employ a user study to evaluate our topic extraction method, as well as the topic-word analysis approach in the context of educational peer-review analysis. Our results show that the proposed method is better than a baseline in terms of capturing student reviewing/writing performance. While users generally identify student writing/reviewing performance correctly, participants who have prior teaching or peer-review experience tend to have better performance on our review exploration tasks, as well as higher satisfaction towards the proposed review analysis approach. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Rafferty2013,"Estimating students’ knowledge based on their interactions with computer-based tutors has the potential to improve learning by decreasing time taking assessments and facilitating personalized interventions. Although there exist good student models for relatively structured topics and tutors, less progress has been made with more open-ended activities. Further, students often complete activities in pairs rather than individually, with no coding to indicate who performed each action. We investigate whether pair interactions with an open-ended chemistry tutor can be used to predict individual student post test performance. Using L1-regularized regression, we show that student interactions with the tutor are predictive both of the average post-test score for the pair and of individual scores. Towards better understanding pair dynamics in this setting, we also find that for pairs composed of students with similar pre-test scores, we can predict the difference in students’ post-test scores. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Some researchers have been working on student modeling to predict delayed performance, that is, retention. Prior work has found that the factors influencing retention differ from those that influence short-term performance. However, this prior research did not use data which were specially targeted to measure retention. In this study, we describe our experiments of using dedicated retention performance data to test the students’ ability to retain, and experiment with a new feature called mastery speed, indicates how many problems the students need to attain initial mastery. We found that this new feature is the most useful of our features. It’s not only a helpful predictor for 7-day retention tests, but also a long-term factor that influences students’ later retention tests even after 105 days. We also found that, although statistically reliable, most features are not useful predictors, such as the number of students’ previous correct and incorrect responses which are not as helpful in predicting students’ retention performance as in PFA. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Xie2013,"This study explored the relationship between students’ math ability and effort in predicting 6th grade students’ performance in the Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) system. The students were clustered into four groups by K-means: high ability high effort, high ability low effort, low ability high effort and low ability low effort. A one-way ANOVA indicated that student’s math posttest within the high ability, high effort group was significantly higher than other groups. An interaction was therefore observed between ability and effort. Further analysis revealed that math ability and effort had a multiplication impact on students’ math posttest. That is, expending effort improves student’s math posttest but how much progress in mathematics is achieved depends on the student’s math ability. Higher students’ math ability multiplies with effort in determining performance. © 2013 International educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Hershkovitz2013,"In recent years, student modeling has been extended from predicting future student performance on the skills being learned in a tutor to predicting a student’s preparation for future learning (PFL). These methods have predicted PFL from a combination of features of students’ behaviors related to meta-cognition. However, these models have achieved only moderately better performance at predicting PFL than traditional methods for latent knowledge estimation, such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing. We propose an alternate paradigm for predicting PFL, using quantitative aspects of the moment-by-moment learning graph. This graph represents individual students’ learning over time and is developed using a knowledge-estimation model which infers the degree of learning that occurs at specific moments rather than the student's knowledge state at those moments. As such, we analyze learning trajectories in a fine-grained fashion. This new paradigm achieves substantially better student-level cross-validated prediction of student’s PFL than previous approaches. Particularly, we find that learning which is spread out over time, with multiple instances of significant improvement occurring with substantial gaps between them, is associated with more robust learning than either very steady learning or learning characterized by a single “eureka” moment or a single period of rapid improvement. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,SanPedro2013,"Research shows that middle school is an important juncture for a student where he or she starts to be conscious about academic achievement and thinks about college attendance. It is already known that access to financial resources, family background, career aspirations and academic ability are indicative of a student’s choice to attend college; though these variables are interesting, they do not necessarily give sufficient actionable information to instructors or guidance counselors to intervene for individual students. However, increasing numbers of students are using educational software at this phase of their education, and detectors of specific aspects of student learning and engagement have been developed for these types of learning environments. If these types of models can be used to predict college attendance, it may provide more actionable information than the previous generation of predictive models. In this paper, we predict college attendance from these types of detectors, in the context of 3,747 students using the ASSISTment system in New England, producing detection that is both successful and potentially more actionable than previous approaches; we can distinguish between a student who will attend college and a student who will not attend college 68.6% of the time. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Fancsali2013,"By implementing mastery learning, intelligent tutoring systems aim to present students with exactly the amount of instruction they need to master a concept. In practice, determination of mastery is imperfect. Student knowledge must be inferred from performance, and performance does not always follow knowledge. A standard method is to set a threshold for mastery, representing a level of certainty that the student has attained mastery. Tutors can make two types of errors when assessing student knowledge: (1) false positives, in which a student without knowledge is judged to have mastered a skill, and (2) false negatives, in which a student is presented with additional practice opportunities after acquiring knowledge. Viewed from this perspective, the mastery threshold can be viewed as a parameter that controls the relative frequency of false negatives and false positives. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding the role of the mastery threshold in Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and use simulations to model the effects of setting different thresholds under different best and worst-case skill modeling assumptions. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Grafsgaard2013,"Learning involves a rich array of cognitive and affective states. Recognizing and understanding these cognitive and affective dimensions of learning is key to designing informed interventions. Prior research has highlighted the importance of facial expressions in learning-centered affective states, but tracking facial expression poses significant challenges. This paper presents an automated analysis of fine-grained facial movements that occur during computer-mediated tutoring. We use the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT) to track fine-grained facial movements consisting of eyebrow raising (inner and outer), brow lowering, eyelid tightening, and mouth dimpling within a naturalistic video corpus of tutorial dialogue (N=65). Within the dataset, upper face movements were found to be predictive of engagement, frustration, and learning, while mouth dimpling was a positive predictor of learning and self-reported performance. These results highlight how both intensity and frequency of facial expressions predict tutoring outcomes. Additionally, this paper presents a novel validation of an automated tracking tool on a naturalistic tutoring dataset, comparing CERT results with manual annotations across a prior video corpus. With the advent of readily available fine-grained facial expression recognition, the developments introduced here represent a next step toward automatically understanding moment-by-moment affective states during learning. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

In addition, a model built using only 7th grade data and a single standardized test outcome (Virginia’s SOL) generalizes to additional grade levels (6 and 8) and standardized test outcomes (NWEA’s MAP). © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Maull2013,"As technology continues to disrupt education at nearly all levels from K–12 to college and beyond, the challenges of understanding the impact technology has on teaching continue to mount. One critical area that yet remains open, is examining teachers’ usage of technology by specifically collecting detailed data of their technology use, developing techniques to analyze that data and then finding meaningful connections that may show the value of that technology. In this research, we will present a model for predicting test score gains using data points drawn from typical educational data sources such as teacher experience, student demographics and classroom dynamics, as well as from the online usage behaviors of teachers. Building upon prior work in developing a usage typology of teachers using an online curriculum planning system, the Curriculum Customization Service (CCS), to assist in the development of their instruction and planning for an Earth systems curriculum, we apply the results of this typology to add new information to a model for predicting test score gains on a district-level Earth systems subject area exam. Using both multinomial logistic regression and Naïve Bayes algorithms on the proposed model, we show that even with a simplification of the highly complex tapestry of variables that go into teacher and student performance, teacher usage of the CCS proved valuable to the predictive capability in average and above average test score gains cases. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Liu2013,"Open-ended educational tools can encourage creativity and active engagement, and may be used beyond the classroom. Being able to model and predict learner performance in such tools is a critical component to assist the student, and enable tool refinement. However, open-ended educational domains typically allow an extremely broad range of learner input. As such, building the same kind of cognitive models often used to track and predict student behavior in existing systems is challenging. In addition, the resulting large spaces of user input coupled with comparatively sparse observed data, limits the applicability of straightforward classification methods. We address these difficulties with a new algorithm that combines Markov models, state aggregation, and player heuristic search, dynamically selecting between these methods based on the amount of available data. Applied to a popular educational game, our hybrid model achieved greater predictive accuracy than any of the methods alone, and performed significantly better than a random baseline. We demonstrate how our model can learn player heuristics on data from one task that accurately predict performance on future tasks, and explain how our model retains parameters that are interpretable to non-expert users. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Beck2013,"There has been a large body of work in the field of EDM involving predicting whether the student’s next attempt will be correct. Many promising ideas have resulted in negligible gains in accuracy, with differences in the thousandths place on RMSE or R2. This paper explores how well we can expect student modeling approaches to perform at this task. We attempt to place an upper limit on model accuracy by performing a series of cheating experiments. We investigate how well a student model can perform that has: perfect information about a student’s incoming knowledge, the ability to detect the exact moment when a student learns a skill (binary knowledge), and the ability to precisely estimate a student’s level of knowledge (continuous knowledge). We find that binary knowledge model has an AUC of 0.804 on our sample data, relative to a baseline PFA model with a 0.745. If we weaken our cheating model slightly, such that it no longer knows student incoming knowledge but simply assumes students are incorrect on their first attempt, AUC drops to 0.747. Consequently, we argue that many student modeling techniques are relatively close to ceiling performance, and there are probably not large gains in accuracy to be had. In addition, knowledge tracing and performance factors analysis, two popular techniques, correlate with each other at 0.96 indicating few differences between them. We conclude by arguing that there are more useful student modeling tasks such as detecting robust learning or wheel-spinning, and estimating parameters such as optimal spacing that are deserving of attention. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Herold2013,"A key challenge in educational data mining research is capturing student work in a form suitable for computational analysis. Online learning environments, such as intelligent tutoring systems, have proven to be one effective means for accomplishing this. Here, we investigate a method for capturing students’ ordinary handwritten coursework in digital form. We provided students with LivescribeTMdigital pens which they used to complete all of their homework and exams. These pens work as traditional pens but additionally digitize students’ handwriting into time-stamped pen strokes enabling us to analyze not only the final image, but also the sequence in which it was written. By applying data mining techniques to digital copies of students’ handwritten work, we seek to gain insights into the cognitive processes employed by students in an ordinary work environment. We present a novel transformation of the pen stroke data, which represents each student’s homework solution as a sequence of discrete actions. We apply differential data mining techniques to these sequences to identify those patterns of actions that are more frequently exhibited by either good- or poor-performing students. We compute numerical features from those patterns which we use to predict performance in the course. The resulting model explains up to 34.4% of the variance in students’ final course grade. Furthermore the underlying parameters of the model indicate which patterns best correlate with positive performance. These patterns in turn provide valuable insight into the cognitive processes employed by students, which can be directly used by the instructor to identify and address deficiencies in students’ understanding. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Supervised classifiers trained on global and local features extracted from students’ gaze fixations 3, 5, 10, and 15 seconds before each probe were used to predict mind wandering with a leave-several-subjects-out cross validation procedure. The most accurate model tracked both global and local eye gaze in a 5-second window before a probe and yielded a kappa (accuracy after correcting for chance) of 0.23 on a downsampled corpus containing 50% yes and 50% no responses to probes.

The first algorithm is nonadaptive and uses graded responses from a prior set of learners. This algorithm is appropriate when the instructor has access to only the learners’ responses after all questions have been solved. The second algorithm adaptively selects the “next best question” for each learner based on their graded responses to date.

conference,Lan2013,"Modern machine learning methods are critical to the development of large-scale personalized learning systems that cater directly to the needs of individual learners. The recently developed SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) framework jointly estimates learner’s knowledge of the latent concepts underlying a domain and the relationships among a collection of questions and the latent concepts, solely from the graded responses to a collection of questions. To better interpret the estimated latent concepts, SPARFA relies on a post-processing step that utilizes user-defined tags (e.g., topics or keywords) available for each question. In this paper, we relax the need for user-defined tags by extending SPARFA to jointly process both graded learner responses and the text of each question and its associated answer(s) or other feedback. Our purely data-driven approach (i) enhances the interpretability of the estimated latent concepts without the need of explicitly generating a set of tags or performing a post-processing step, (ii) improves the prediction performance of SPARFA, and (iii) scales to large test/assessments where human annotation would prove burdensome.

conference,Vega2013,"Boredom and disengagement have been found to negatively impact learning. Therefore, it is important for learning environments to be able to track when students disengage from a learning task. We investigated a method to track engagement during self-paced reading by analyzing reading times. We propose that a breakdown in the relationship between reading time and text complexity can reveal disengagement. A discrepancy (or decoupling) between attention resources and text complexity was computed via the absolute difference between reading times and the text’s Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, a measure of text complexity. As expected, decoupling varied as a function of text complexity. We also found that text complexity differentially impacted decoupling profiles for different types of participants (i.e., high vs. low comprehenders, fast vs. slow readers). These results suggest that decoupling scores may be a viable method to track disengagement during reading and could be used to trigger interventions to help students re-engage with the text and ultimately learn the material more effectively. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Martinez-Maldonado2013,"Large amounts of data are generated while students interact with computer based learning systems. These data can be analysed through data mining techniques to find patterns or train models that can help tutoring systems or teachers to provide better support. Yet, how can we exploit students’ data when they perform small-group face-to-face activities in the classroom? We propose a novel approach that aims to address this by discovering the strategies followed by students working in small-groups at a multi-tabletop classroom. We apply two data mining techniques, sequence and process mining, to analyse the actions that distinguish groups that needed more coaching from the ones that worked more effectively. To validate our approach we analysed data that was automatically collected from a series of authentic university tutorial classes. The contributions of this paper are: i) an approach to mine face-to-face collaboration data unobtrusively captured at a classroom with the use of multi-touch tabletops, and ii) the implementation of sequence mining and process modelling techniques to analyse the strategies followed by groups of students.

conference,Liu2013,"In this paper, we use sensor-free affect detection [4] and a discovery with models approach to explore the relationship between affect occurring over varying durations and learning outcomes among students using Cognitive Tutor Algebra. Researchers have suggested that the affective state of confusion can have positive effects on learning as long as students are able to resolve their confusion [10, 22], and recent research seems to accord with this hypothesis [17]. However, there is some room for concern that some of this earlier work may have conflated frustration and confusion. We replicate these analyses using sensor-free automated detectors trained to distinguish these two affective states. Our analyses suggest that the effect may be stronger for frustration than confusion, but is strongest when these two affective states are taken together.

conference,Pardos2013,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are an increasingly pervasive newcomer to the virtual landscape of higher-education, delivering a wide variety of topics in science, engineering, and the humanities. However, while technological innovation is enabling unprecedented open access to high quality educational material, these systems generally inherit similar homework, exams, and instructional resources to that of their classroom counterparts and currently lack an underlying model with which to talk about learning. In this paper we will show how existing learner modeling techniques based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing can be adapted to the inaugural course, 6.002x: circuit design, on the edX MOOC platform. We identify three distinct challenges to modeling MOOC data and provide predictive evaluations of the respective modeling approach to each challenge. The challenges identified are; lack of an explicit knowledge component model, allowance for unpenalized multiple problem attempts, and multiple pathways through the system that allow for learning influences outside of the current assessment. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Hawkins2013,"In the field of educational data mining, there are competing methods for predicting student performance. One involves building complex models, such as Bayesian networks with Knowledge Tracing (KT), or using logistic regression with Performance Factors Analysis (PFA). However, Wang and Heffernan showed that a raw data approach can be applied successfully to educational data mining with their results from what they called the Assistance Model (AM), which takes the number of attempts and hints required to answer the previous question correctly into account, which KT and PFA ignore. We extend their work by introducing a general framework for using raw data to predict student performance, and explore a new way of making predictions within this framework, called the Assistance Progress Model (APM). APM makes predictions based on the relationship between the assistance used on the two previous problems. KT, AM and APM are evaluated and compared to one another, as are multiple methods of ensembling them together.

We gathered logs of learner interactions with a drill and practice learning environment in college mathematics. Detailed logs of student usage was gathered for four months. Student activity sessions are extracted from the logs and clustered in three categories. Visualization of clusters allows a clear and intuitive interpretation of the activities within the clustered sessions. The three clusters are further used to visualize the global activity of the 69 participating students, which would otherwise be difficult to grasp without such means to extract patterns of use. The results reveal highly distinct patterns. In particular, they reveal an unexpected and substantial amount of navigation through exercises and notes without students actually trying the exercises themselves.

However, little is known about how these competencies interact: does representational understanding facilitate learning of fluency (understanding-first hypothesis), or does fluency enhance learning of representational understanding (fluency-first hypothesis)? We analyze log data obtained from an experiment that investigates the effects of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) support for understanding and fluency in connection-making between fractions representations. The experiment shows that instructional support for both representational understanding and fluency are needed for students to benefit from the ITS. In analyzing the ITS log data, we contrast the understanding-first hypothesis and the fluency-first hypothesis, testing whether errors made during the learning phase mediate the effect of experimental condition. Finding that a simple statistical model does not the fit data, we searched over all plausible causal path analysis models.

conference,Falakmasir2013,"Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a common way of determining student knowledge of skills in adaptive educational systems and cognitive tutors. The basic BKT is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that models student knowledge based on five parameters: prior, learn rate, forget, guess, and slip. Expectation Maximization (EM) is often used to learn these parameters from training data. However, EM is a time-consuming process, and is prone to converging to erroneous, implausible local optima depending on the initial values of the BKT parameters. In this paper we address these two problems by using spectral learning to learn a Predictive State Representation (PSR) that represents the BKT HMM. We then use a heuristic to extract the BKT parameters from the learned PSR using basic matrix operations. The spectral learning method is based on an approximate factorization of the estimated covariance of windows from students’ sequences of correct and incorrect responses; it is fast, local-optimum-free, and statistically consistent. In the past few years, spectral techniques have been used on real-world problems involving latent variables in dynamical systems, computer vision, and natural language processing. Our results suggest that the parameters learned by the spectral algorithm can replace the parameters learned by EM; the results of our study show that the spectral algorithm can improve knowledge tracing parameter-fitting time significantly while maintaining the same prediction accuracy, or help to improve accuracy while still keeping parameter-fitting time equivalent to EM. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Rhodes2013,"Numerous studies have shown that self-explanation can lead to improved learning outcomes. Here we examine how the words which students use in their self-explanations correlate with their performance in the course as well as with the effort they expend on their homework assignments. We compute two types of numerical features to characterize students’ work: vocabulary-based features and effort-based features. The vocabulary-based features capture the frequency with which individual words and n-grams appear within students’ self-explanation. The effort-based features estimate the effort expended on each assignment as the amount of time spent writing a homework solution or self-explanation response. We use the most predictive vocabulary-based and effort-based features to train a linear regression model to predict students’ overall course grade. This model explains up to 19.4% of the variance in students’ performance. Furthermore, the underlying parameters of this model provide valuable insights into the ways students explain their own work, and the cognitive processes students employ when asked to self-explain. Additionally, we use the vocabulary-based features to train linear regression models to predict each of the effort-based features. In doing so we demonstrate that the vocabulary employed by a student to self-explain his or her solution to an assignment correlates with the amount of effort that student expends on that particular assignment. Both of these findings serve as a basis for a novel automated assessment technique for evaluating student performance. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Mokbel2013,"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) typically analyze student solutions to provide feedback to students for a given learning task. Machine learning (ML) tools can help to reduce the necessary effort of tailoring ITSs to a specific task or domain. For example, training a classification model can facilitate feedback provision by revealing discriminative characteristics in the solutions. In many ML methods, the notion of proximity in the investigated data plays an important role, e.g. to evaluate classification boundaries. For this purpose, solutions need to be represented in an appropriate form, so their (dis-)similarity can be calculated. We discuss options for domain- and task-independent proximity measures in the context of ITSs, which are based on the ample premise that solutions can be represented as formal graphs. We propose to identify and match meaningful contextual components in the solutions, and present first evaluation results for artificial as well as real student solutions. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Kinnebrew2013,"Identifying sequential patterns in learning activity data can be useful for discovering, understanding, and ultimately scaffolding student learning behaviors in computer-based learning environments. Algorithms for mining sequential patterns generally associate some measure of pattern frequency in the data with the relative importance or ranking of the pattern. However, another important aspect of these patterns is the evolution of their usage over the course of a student’s learning or problem-solving activities. In order to identify and analyze learning behavior patterns of more interest in terms of both their overall frequency and their evolution over time, we present a data mining technique that combines sequence mining with a novel information-theoretic, temporal-interestingness measure and a corresponding heat map visualization. We demonstrate the utility of this technique through application to student activity data from a recent experiment with the Betty’s Brain learning environment and a comparison of our algorithm’s pattern rankings with those of an expert.

conference,Pawl2013,A popular type of problem in online homework involves a set of several true/false statements and requires that students submit their answers to all the statements at once. Such problems can force a student to submit many responses to the same true/false statement. It is possible to examine student submission patterns to problems of this type with the goal of determining which of the individual true/false statements exhibit a large proportion of response switches and which statements exhibit largely consistent responses. This paper describes algorithms that allow an instructor to uncover those statements that exhibit class-wide randomness and also those that exhibit a class-wide preference for an incorrect response. The utility of the approach is suggested by the fact that examining statements which emerge as outliers according to these metrics uncovers several statements that probe known student misconceptions. © 2013 International Educational Data Mining Society.

conference,Tan2012,"Bayesian ability estimation is a statistical inferential framework constructed from a measurement model and a prior knowledge model. It is attractive in practice because Bayesian estimation methods offer an elegant way to incorporate appropriate knowledge on target ability distribution in order to improve the accuracy of ability estimation, when there are uncertainties or errors in observable data. One hurdle for applying Bayesian-based methods is evaluating the validity of Bayesian ability estimates at individual-level. This study investigated a class of fit-to-model statistics for quantifying the evidence used in learning Bayesian estimates. The relationship between fit-to-model statistics and root mean square error of Bayesian ability estimation was demonstrated with simulation. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Stamper2012,"Traditional experimental paradigms have focused on executing experiments in a lab setting and eventually moving successful findings to larger experiments in the field. However, data from field experiments can also be used to inform new lab experiments. Now, with the advent of large student populations using internet-based learning software, online experiments can serve as a third setting for experimental data collection. In this paper, we introduce the Super Experiment Framework (SEF), which describes how internet-scale experiments can inform and be informed by classroom and lab experiments. We apply the framework to a research project implementing learning games for mathematics that is collecting hundreds of thousands of data trials weekly. We show that the framework allows findings from the lab-scale, classroom-scale and internet-scale experiments to inform each other in a rapid complementary feedback loop. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Rus2012,"In this paper we address the important task of automated discovery of speech act categories in dialogue-based, multi-party educational games. Speech acts are important in dialogue-based educational systems because they help infer the student speaker’s intentions (the task of speech act classification) which in turn is crucial to providing adequate feedback and scaffolding. A key step in the speech act classification task is defining the speech act categories in an underlying speech act taxonomy. Most research to date has relied on taxonomies which are guided by experts’ intuitions, which we refer to as an extrinsic design of the speech act taxonomies. A pure data-driven approach would discover the natural groupings of dialogue utterances and therefore reveal the intrinsic speech act categories. To this end, this paper presents a fully-automated data-driven method to discover speech act taxonomies based on utterance clustering. Experiments were conducted on three datasets from three online educational games. This work is a step towards building speech act taxonomies based on both extrinsic (expert-driven) and intrinsic aspects (data-driven) of the target domain. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Rau2012,"Although learning from multiple representations has been shown to be effective in a variety of domains, little is known about the mechanisms by which it occurs. We analyzed log data on error-rate, hint-use, and time-spent obtained from two experiments with a Cognitive Tutor for fractions. The goal of the experiments was to compare learning from multiple graphical representations of fractions to learning from a single graphical representation. Finding that a simple statistical model did not fit data from either experiment, we searched over all possible mediation models consistent with background knowledge, finding several that fit the data well. We also searched over alternative measures of student error-rate, hint-use, and time-spent to see if our data were better modeled with simple monotonic or u-shaped non-monotonic relationships. We found no evidence for non-monotonicity. No matter what measures we used, time-spent was irrelevant, and hint-use was only occasionally relevant. Although the total effect of multiple representations on learning was positive, they also had a negative effect on learning, mediated by a higher error-rate. Our evidence suggests that multiple representations increase error-rate, which in turn inhibits learning. The mechanisms by which multiple representations improve learning are as yet unmodeled. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Bergner2012,"We apply collaborative filtering (CF) to dichotomously scored student response data (right, wrong, or no interaction), finding optimal parameters for each student and item based on cross-validated prediction accuracy. The approach is naturally suited to comparing different models, both unidimensional and multidimensional in ability, including a widely used subset of Item Response Theory (IRT) models which obtain as specific instances of the CF: the one-parameter logistic (Rasch) model, Birnbaum’s 2PL model, and Reckase’s multidimensional generalization M2PL. We find that IRT models perform well relative to generalized alternatives, and thus this method offers a fast and stable alternate approach to IRT parameter estimation. Using both real and simulated data we examine cases where one- or two-dimensional IRT models prevail and are not improved by increasing the number of features. Model selection is based on prediction accuracy of the CF, though it is shown to be consistent with factor analysis. In multidimensional cases the item parameterizations can be used in conjunction with cluster analysis to identify groups of items which measure different ability dimensions. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

Many students admit, or are self-aware, that they become stressed under different circumstances and have some clues about their potential stressor. Still, even for such students, the monitoring and awareness of stress are not systematic and based on subjective data, i.e. someone’s feelings.

conference,Rafferty2012,"Teachers gain significant information about their students through close observation of classroom activities. By noting which actions a student takes to achieve particular goals, a teacher can often infer the knowledge possessed by the student and diagnose misconceptions. In this work, we develop a framework for automatically inferring a student’s underlying beliefs from a set of observed actions. This framework relies on modeling how student actions follow from beliefs about the effects of those actions. We demonstrate the practicality of this approach by modeling empirical student data from an educational game and validate its performance via a controlled lab experiment. In the educational game, inferences were consistent with conventional assessment measures; in the lab experiment, the model’s inferences reflect participants’ stated beliefs. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Trivedi2012,"Learning a more distributed representation of the input feature space is a powerful method to boost the performance of a given predictor. Often this is accomplished by partitioning the data into homogeneous groups by clustering so that separate models could be trained on each cluster. Intuitively each such predictor is a better representative of the members of the given cluster than a predictor trained on the entire data-set. Previous work has used this basic premise to construct a simple yet strong bagging strategy. However, such models have one significant drawback: Instances (such as students) are clustered while features (tutor usage features/items) are left alone. One-way clustering by using some objective function measures the degree of homogeneity between data instances. Often it is noticed that features also influence final prediction in homogeneous groups. This indicates a duality in the relationship between clusters of instances and clusters of features. Co-Clustering simultaneously measures the degree of homogeneity in both data instances and features, thus also achieving clustering and dimensionality reduction simultaneously. Students and features could be modelled as a bipartite graph and a simultaneous clustering could be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. In this paper we integrate an effective bagging strategy with Co-Clustering and present results for prediction of out-of-tutor performance of students. We report that such a strategy is very useful and intuitive, even improving upon performance achieved by previous work. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Goldin2012,"Although ITSs are supposed to adapt to differences among learners, so far, little attention has been paid to how they might adapt to differences in how students learn from help. When students study with an Intelligent Tutoring System, they may receive multiple types of help, but may not comprehend and make use of this help in the same way. To measure the extent of such individual differences, we propose two new logistic regression models, ProfHelp and ProfHelp-ID. Both models extend the Performance Factors Analysis model (Pavlik, Cen & Koedinger, 2009) with parameters that represent the effect of hints on performance on the same step on which the help was given. Both models adjust for general student proficiency, prior practice on knowledge components, and knowledge component difficulty. Multilevel Bayesian implementations of these models were fit to data on student interactions with a geometry ITS, where students received on-demand problem-relevant help ranging from first-level hints that facilitate application of principles to specific and immediately actionable bottom-out hints. The model comparison showed that in this dataset students differ in their individual hint-processing proficiency and these differences depend on hint levels. These results suggest that we can assess specific learning skills, e.g., making sense of instructional text, and in future work we may be able to remediate and improve such skills. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

Students are classified into SRL-use categories based on evidence of goal-setting and monitoring activities. Prior work on early prediction of these categories pointed to logistic regression and decision tree models as effective techniques.

conference,Bouchet2012,"Identification of student learning behaviors, especially those that characterize or distinguish students, can yield important insights for the design of adaptation and feedback mechanisms in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). In this paper, we analyze trace data to identify distinguishing patterns of behavior in a study of 51 college students learning about a complex science topic with an agent-based ITS that fosters self-regulated learning (SRL). Preliminary analysis with an Expectation-Maximization clustering algorithm revealed the existence of three distinct groups of students, distinguished by their test and quiz scores (low for the first group, medium for the second group, and high for the third group), their learning gains (low, medium, high), the frequency of their note-taking (rare, frequent, rare) and note-checking (rare, rare, frequent), the proportion of sub-goals attempted (low, low, high), and the time spent reading (high, high, low). In this paper, we extend this analysis to identify characteristic learning behaviors and strategies that distinguish these three groups of students. We employ a differential sequence mining technique to identify differentially frequent activity patterns between the student groups and interpret these patterns in terms of relevant learning behaviors. The results of this analysis reveal that high-performing students tend to be better at quickly identifying the relevance of a page to their subgoal, are more methodical in their exploration of the pedagogical content, rely on system prompts to take notes and summarize, and are more strategic in their preparation for the post-test (e.g., using the end of their session to briefly review pages). These results provide a first step in identifying the group to which a student belongs during the learning session, thus making possible a real-time adaptation of the system. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Kinnebrew2012,"Our learning-by-teaching environment, Betty’s Brain, captures a wealth of data on students’ learning interactions as they teach a virtual agent. This paper extends an exploratory data mining methodology for assessing and comparing students’ learning behaviors from these interaction traces. The core algorithm employs sequence mining techniques to identify differentially frequent patterns between two predefined groups. We extend this technique by contextualizing the sequence mining with information on the student’s task performance and learning activities. Specifically, we study transformation of action sequences using action features, such as activity categorizations, relevance and timing between actions, and repetition of analogous actions. We employ a piecewise linear segmentation algorithm in concert with the action transformation and differential sequence mining techniques to identify and compare segments of students’ productive and unproductive learning behaviors. We present the results of this methodology applied to a recent middle school class study, in which students learned about climate change.

conference,Yoo2012,"Concept maps, visual representations of knowledge, are used in an educational context as a way to represent students’ knowledge, and identify mental models of students; however there is a limitation of using concept mapping due to its difficulty to evaluate the concept maps. A concept map has a complex structure which is composed of concepts and their relationships that often have a weighted direction. This work explores the feasibility of the analysis of concept maps using data mining methods, and investigate the possibility of using concept maps as a research tool to understand college student’s learning. A total of 111 college students participated in this study. The findings from frequent concept mining and sub-concept map mining suggest that students expect a traditional way of learning.

conference,Maldonado2012,"The research space on educational data mining exploiting data captured from the collaborative learning interactions of students, particularly in face-to-face environments, is vast but still basically unexplored. Students who build a solution in a group have to externalise and make their understandings about the topic explicit to establish common ground with their peers. This offers an enormous opportunity to capture the digital footprints of the process followed by students, these can be used to uncover patterns linked with successful collaboration and learning skills. The full spectrum of emerging technologies to support classroom and small-group work are opening up the possibility to investigate aspects of collocated collaboration. These technologies include interactive tabletops, digital whiteboards and multi-display settings. We present a method to capture, exploit and mine the digital footprints of students working face-to-face to build a concept map at an interactive tabletop. This includes a system that has a mechanism for recording the history of the collaborative process including the partial versions of the solution, applications logs, individual contributions and verbal participation of each student.

conference,Beheshti2012,"Identifying the skills that determine the success or failure to exercises and question items is a difficult task. Multiple skills may be involved at various degree of importance, and skills may overlap and correlate. In an effort towards the goal of finding the skills behind a set of items, we investigate two techniques to determine the number of dominant latent skills. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a known technique to find latent factors. The singular values represent direct evidence of the strength of latent factors. Application of SVD to finding the number of latent skills is explored. We introduce a second technique based on a wrapper approach. Linear models with different number of skills are built, and the one that yields the best prediction accuracy through cross validation is considered the most appropriate. The results show that both techniques are effective in identifying the latent factors over synthetic data. An investigation with real data from the fraction algebra domain is also reported. Both the SVD and wrapper methods yield results that have no simple interpretation. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Wang2012,"The goal of predicting student behavior on the immediate next action has been investigated by researchers for many years. However, a fair question is whether this research question is worth all of the attention it has received. This paper investigates predicting student performance after a delay of 5 to 10 days, to determine whether, and when, the student will retain the material seen. Although this change in focus sounds minor, two aspects make it interesting. First, the factors influencing retention are different than those influencing short-term performance. Specifically, we found that the number of student correct and incorrect responses were not reliable predictors of long-term performance. This result is in contrast to most student-modeling efforts on predicting performance on the next response. Second, we argue that answering the question of whether a student will retain a skill is more useful for guiding decision making of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) than predicting correctness of next response. We introduce an architecture that identifies two research topics that are meaningful for ITS decision making. Our experiments found one feature in particular that was relevant for student retention: the number of distinct days in which a student practiced a skill. This result provides additional evidence for the spaced practice effect, and suggests our models need to be aware of features known to impact retention. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Xu2012,"A long-standing challenge for knowledge tracing is how to update estimates of multiple subskills that underlie a single observable step. We characterize approaches to this problem by how they model knowledge tracing, fit its parameters, predict performance, and update subskill estimates. Previous methods allocated blame or credit among subskills in various ways based on strong assumptions about their relation to observed performance. LR-DBN relaxes these assumptions by using logistic regression in a Dynamic Bayes Net. LR-DBN significantly outperforms previous methods on data sets from reading and algebra tutors in terms of predictive accuracy on unseen data, cutting the error rate by half. An ablation experiment shows that using logistic regression to predict performance helps, but that using it to jointly estimate subskills explains most of this dramatic improvement.

In this paper we take a deeper look at what reported errors actually mean in the context of high stakes test score prediction as well as student mastery prediction. We report how differences in common error and accuracy metrics on prediction tasks translate to impact on students and depict how standard validation methods can lead to overestimated accuracies in these prediction tasks.

conference,Sudol2012,"In complex problem solving domains, correct solutions are often comprised of a combination of individual components. Students usually go through several attempts, each attempt reflecting an individual solution state that can be observed during practice. Classic metrics to measure student performance over time rely on counting the number of submissions or focusing on time taken to complete the problem correctly. These metrics are not robust to the correction of errors that may increase problem solving time, and do not reflect topical misunderstandings on the part of the student. In this paper we propose a metric to measure the probabilistic distance between an observed student solution and a correct solution. Students working in an online programming environment completed four practice problems. Their submissions were then evaluated against a model of the algorithmic components necessary for a correct solution. A Markov Model was used to generate a problem state graph. Our proposed Probabilistic Distance to Solution (PDS) metric was applied to the graph to determine the distance, in program states, from an observed program model to the model of a correct solution. Results indicate that the PDS is useful in determining if an edit or student path is (a) typical of students who have mastered content, and (b) productive in progressing toward a solution. We offer implementation details of PDS and implications for future work based upon current observations. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

Experiments were carried out using real data from first-year university students. Several clustering algorithms using the proposed approach were compared with traditional classification algorithms in predicting whether students pass or fail the course on the basis of their Moodle forum usage data. The results show that the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) clustering algorithm yields results similar to those of the best classification algorithms, especially when using only a group of selected attributes.

Specifically, this experiment compared different practice schedules of multiple representations of fractions: representations were presented to students either in an interleaved or in a blocked fashion. The results obtained from posttests demonstrate an advantage of interleaving representations. Using methods derived from Knowledge Tracing, we investigate whether we can replicate the contextual interference effect, an effect commonly found when investigating practice schedules of different task types. Different Knowledge Tracing models were adapted and compared. A model that included practice schedules as a predictor of students’ learning was most successful. A comparison of learning rate estimates between conditions shows that even during the acquisition phase, students working with interleaved representations demonstrate higher learning rates. This finding stands in contrast to the commonly found contextual interference effect when interleaving task types.

conference,González-Brenes2012,"This work describes a unified approach to two problems previously addressed separately in Intelligent Tutoring Systems: (i) Cognitive Modeling, which factorizes problem solving steps into the latent set of skills required to perform them [7]; and (ii) Student Modeling, which infers students’ learning by observing student performance [9]. The practical importance of improving understanding of how students learn is to build better intelligent tutors [8]. The expected advantages of our integrated approach include (i) more accurate prediction of a student’s future performance, and (ii) clustering items into skills automatically, without expensive manual expert knowledge annotation.

conference,Barker-Plummer2012,"We have assembled a large corpus of student submissions to an automatic grading system, where the subject matter involves the translation of natural language sentences into propositional logic. Of the 2.3 million translation instances in the corpus, 286,000 (approximately 12%) are categorized as being in error. We want to understand the nature of the errors that students make, so that we can develop tools and supporting infrastructure that help students with the problems that these errors represent. With this aim in mind, this paper describes an analysis of a significant proportion of the data, using edit distance between incorrect answers and their corresponding correct solutions, and the associated edit sequences, as a means of organising the data and detecting categories of errors. We demonstrate that a large proportion of errors can be accounted for by means of a small number of relatively simple error types, and that the method draws attention to interesting phenomena in the data set. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Baker2012,"In recent years, the usefulness of affect detection for educational software has become clear. Accurate detection of student affect can support a wide range of interventions with the potential to improve student affect, increase engagement, and improve learning. In addition, accurate detection of student affect could play an essential role in research attempting to understand the root causes and impacts of different forms of affect. However, current approaches to affect detection have largely relied upon sensor systems, which are expensive and typically not physically robust to classroom conditions, reducing their potential real-world impact. Work towards sensor-free affect detection has produced detectors that are better than chance, but not substantially better—especially when subject to stringent cross-validation processes. In this paper we present models which can detect student engaged concentration, confusion, frustration, and boredom solely from students' interactions within a Cognitive Tutor for Algebra. These detectors are designed to operate solely on the information available through students’ semantic actions within the interface, making these detectors applicable both for driving interventions and for labeling existing log files in the PSLC DataShop, facilitating future discovery with models analyses at scale. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

conference,Lee2012,"When modeling student learning, tutors that use the Knowledge Tracing framework often assume that all students have the same set of model parameters. We find that when fitting parameters to individual students, there is significant variation among the individual’s parameters. We examine if this variation is important in terms of instructional decisions by computing the difference in the expected number of practice opportunities required if mastery is assessed using an individual student’s own estimated model parameters, compared to the population model. In the dataset considered, we find that a significant portion of students are expected to perform twice as many practice opportunities if the student is modeled using a population-based model, compared to the number needed if the student’s own model parameters were used. We also find an additional significant portion of students will be likely to receive less practice opportunities than needed, implying that such students will be advanced too early. Though further work on additional datasets is needed to explore this issue in more depth, our results suggest that considering individual variation in student parameters may have important implications for the instructional decisions made in intelligent tutoring systems that use a Knowledge Tracing model. © 2012 www.educationaldatamining.org.

In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically discovers student models using a state-of-art machine learning agent, SimStudent.

These simulations show how strategy use in this task is crucial because of the ways it influences performance, particularly over time.

Even in courses with a few number of students, there could be thousands of messages generated in a few months within these forums. Manually evaluating the participation of students in such case is a significant challenge, considering the fact that current e-learning environments do not provide much information regarding the structure of interactions between students.There is a recent line of research on applying social network analysis (SNA) techniques to study these interactions. And it is interesting to investigate the practicability of SNA in evaluating participation of students. Here we propose to exploit SNA techniques, including community mining, in order to discover relevant structures in social networks we generate from student communications but also information networks we produce from the content of the exchanged messages. With visualization of these discovered relevant structures and the automated identification of central and peripheral participants, an instructor is provided with better means to assess participation in the online discussions. We implemented these new ideas in a toolbox, named Meerkat-ED. Which prepares and visualizes overall snapshots of the participants in the discussion forums, their interactions, and the leader/peripheral students. Moreover, it creates a hierarchical summarization of the discussed topics, which gives the instructor a quick view of what is under discussion.

Means to automate it are highly desirable, even if only partial automation that provides supportive tools can be achieved. A recent technique based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was shown to offer valuable results, especially due to the fact that the resulting factorization allows a straightforward interpretation in terms of a Q-matrix. We investigate the factors and assumptions under which NMF can effectively derive the underlying high level skills behind assessment results. We demonstrate the use of different techniques to analyse and interpret the output of NMF. We propose a simple model to generate simulated data and to provide lower and upper bounds for quantifying skill effect. Using the simulated data, we show that, under the assumption of independent skills, the NMF technique is highly effective in deriving the Q-matrix. However, the NMF performance degrades under different ratios of variance between subject performance, item dificulty, and skill mastery. The results corroborates conclusions from previous work in that high level skills, corresponding to general topics like World History and Biology, seem to have no substantial effect on test performance, whereas other topics like Mathematics and French do.

conference,Cambranes-Martinez2011339,"Computer science and engineering undergraduates must develop problem-solving skills, which are particularly important when solving programming problems which use simple algorithms. Ideally these skills are developed in the early stages of learning programming, in particular during the first weeks or months of a student's first course. For complete beginners, problem solving and logical thinking are key to the development of programming skills. This article presents an initial proposal for a study of complete beginner programmers, i.e. students with no prior formal experience of programming. This research is particularly focused on the period in which students learn basic programming concepts to solve problems. The investigation will include the study and analysis of students' interactions with tools and systems during the problem solving process. Data mining techniques will be used to uncover underlying patterns in the interactions. The goal is to exploit these patterns to enhance tutors' teaching processes.","Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, Mexico; School of Informatics, University of Sussex, United Kingdom","Cambranes-Martinez, E. and Good, J.",Data mining;  Learning programming;  Patterns;  Programming beginners,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 1,,339-340,Scopus,Studying problem-solving strategies in the early stages of learning programming,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857494286&partnerID=40&md5=1347a744e16ec40ae4b172ba5b6a673e,2011
conference,VonDavier2011353,"For testing programs that provide a large number of administrations each year, the challenge of maintaining comparability of test scores is influenced by the potential rapid accumulation of errors and by the lack of time between administrations to apply the usual techniques for detecting and addressing scale drift. Traditional quality control techniques have been developed for tests with only a small number of administrations per year, and therefore, while very valuable and necessary, they are not sufficient for catching changes in a complex and rapid flow of scores. Model-based techniques that can be updated at each administration could be used to flag any unusual patterns. The basis for the paper is recent research conducted at Educational Testing Service. I will describe an application of traditional quality control charts, such as Shewhart and CUSUM charts on testing data, time series models, change point models, and hidden Markov models to the means of scaled scores to detect abrupt changes. Some preliminary data mining approaches and results also will be discussed. This type of data analysis of scaled scores is relatively new and any application of the aforementioned tools is subject to the typical pitfalls: Are the appropriate variables included? Are the identified patterns meaningful? Can time series models or hidden Markov models be generalized to data from other tests?.","Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ, United States","Von Davier, A.A.",Change-point models;  Cusum charts;  Data mining;  Hidden markov models;  Quality control;  Scale drift;  Scaled scores;  Shewhart charts;  Time series,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 3,,353-354,Scopus,Quality control and data mining techniques applied to monitoring scaled scores,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857493878&partnerID=40&md5=7554769bc4fda673dd6a0b3d018cff4f,2011
conference,Koedinger201191,"One function of a student model in tutoring systems is to select future tasks that will best meet student needs. If the inference procedure that updates the model is inaccurate, the system may select non-optimal tasks for enhancing students' learning. Poor selection may arise when the model assumes multiple knowledge components are required for a single correct student behavior. When the student makes an error, a deliberately simple model update procedure uniformly reduces the probability of all components even though just one may be to blame. Until now, we have had no evidence that this simple approach has any bad consequences for students. We present such evidence. We observed problem selection thrashing in analysis of log data from a tutor designed to adaptively fade (or reintroduce) instructional scaffolding based on student performance. We describe a conjunctive knowledge tracing approach, based on techniques from Bayesian networks and psychometrics, and show how it may alleviate thrashing. By applying this approach to the log data, we show that a third (441 of 1370) of the problems students were assigned may have been unnecessary.","Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Carnegie Learning INC., Pittsburgh, United States","Koedinger, K.R. and Pavlik Jr., P.I. and Stamper, J. and Nixon, T. and Ritter, S.",Bayesian inference;  Blame assignment;  Knowledge tracing;  Tutor log data analysis,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 23,,91-100,Scopus,Avoiding problem selection thrashing with conjunctive knowledge tracing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857493788&partnerID=40&md5=15c635ada44040e3274146b48d1ca271,2011

We have evaluated the accuracy of the student model by comparing its predictions to the outcomes of students' logged interactions from a study with 255 school children. Students' logs were used for retrospective training of the Bayesian network parameters. The accuracy of the student model was evaluated from three different perspectives: its ability to predict the outcome of an individual student's answer, the correctness of the answer, and the presence of a particular misconception. The results show that the model's predictions reach a high level of precision, especially in predicting the presence of student misconceptions.","Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany; DFKI GmbH, Saarbrücken, Germany; Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Goguadze, G. and Sosnovsky, S. and Isotani, S. and McLaren, B.M.",Bayesian networks;  Bayesian student modeling;  Student model evaluation,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 17,,301-305,Scopus,Evaluating a bayesian student model of decimal misconceptions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857480243&partnerID=40&md5=5d60d80d5723f84922367dcbee99db43,2011

In this study, we investigated the generality of performance of the simple location heuristic and the simple temporal heuristic in the math domain to see if previous results generalized to other Intelligent Tutoring System domains. In support of past results, we found that the simple location heuristic provided a better goodness of fit to the learning curve standard, that is, it was better at performing error attribution than the simple temporal heuristic. One observation is that for tutors where the knowledge components can be determined by the interface location in which an action appears, using the simple location heuristic is likely to show better results than the simple temporal heuristic. It is possible that the simple temporal heuristic is better in situations where the different problem subgoals can be associated with a single location.

We contrast the causal modeling approach to the results we achieve with traditional approaches such as correlation matrix and multiple regression.

conference,Barker-Plummer201151,"Students find logic hard. In particular, they seem to find it hard to translate natural language sentences into their corresponding representations in logic. As an enabling step towards determining why this is the case, this paper presents the public release of a corpus of over 4.5 million translations of natural language (nl) sentences into first-order logic (fol), provided by 55,000 students from almost 50 countries over a period of 10 years. The translations, provided by the students as fol renderings of a collection of 275 nl sentences, were automatically graded by an online assessment tool, the Grade Grinder. More than 604,000 are in error, exemplifying a wide range of misunderstandings and confusions that students struggle with. The corpus thus provides a rich source of data for discovering how students learn logical concepts and for correlating error patterns with linguistic features. We describe the structure and content of the corpus in some detail, and discuss a range of potentially fruitful lines of enquiry. Our hope is that educational data mining of the corpus will lead to improved logic curricula and teaching practice.","Cordura Hall, CSLI, Stanford University, Stanford CA, 94305, United States; Department of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Department of Computing, Center for Language Technology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109, Australia","Barker-Plummer, D. and Cox, R. and Dale, R.",,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 5,,51-60,Scopus,Student translations of natural language into logic: The grade grinder corpus release 1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857473074&partnerID=40&md5=ef19897b5db21d6e37bdacbea4444bf0,2011
conference,Anaya2011317,"Assessment on collaborative student behavior is a longstanding issue in user modeling. Nowadays thanks to the proliferation of online learning and the vast amount of data on students' interactions this modeling issue features some alternatives. The purpose is not to depend on teachers or students assessments, which either requires management effort difficult to assume (due to some students-per-teacher ratios) or depends on individual motivations (i.e. student willingness on providing explicit feedback related to collaboration). In our research we have shown that based on frequent and regular analysis of those interactions it is feasible to obtain collaborative assessments that concurs with expert valorizations. This approach relies on data mining and machine learning techniques, which are applied to infer collaborative significant student's characteristics such as regularity, in terms of activity and initiative, and student acknowledgment of fellow-students. The advantages of the approach are to obtain domain-independent assessments, applicable in different learning management systems and exploitable over different courses and learning settings without the teacher involvement in the analysis process. The method has been developed from a collaborative experience involving hundreds of students over 3 consecutive year-courses. Here we focus on discussing the improvements on measurements provided during a new collaboration learning experience of this academic year.","Artificial Intelligence Department, School of Computer Science (CSS), UNED, Spain","Anaya, A.R. and Boticario, J.",Collaborative Learning;  Quantitative;  Timely Data Mining Approach,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 3,,317-318,Scopus,Towards improvements on domain-independent measurements for collaborative assessment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857472919&partnerID=40&md5=ba0c4580e1f265fa865385caff86b54b,2011
conference,Chi201161,"In this paper, we proposed a new cognitive modeling approach: Instructional Factors Analysis Model (IFM). It belongs to a class of Knowledge-Component- based cognitive models. More specifically, IFM is targeted for modeling student's performance when multiple types of instructional interventions are involved and some of them may not generate a direct observation of students' performance. We compared IFM to two other pre-existing cognitive models: Additive Factor Models (AFMs) and Performance Factor Models (PFMs). The three methods differ mainly on how a student's previous experience on a Knowledge Component is counted into multiple categories. Among the three models, instructional interventions without immediate direct observations can be easily incorporate into the AFM and IFM models. Therefore, they are further compared on two important tasks-unseen student prediction and unseen step prediction-and to determine whether the extra flexibility afforded by addi- tional parameters leads to better models, or just to over fitting. Our results suggested that, for datasets involving multiple types of learning interventions, dividing student learning opportunities into multiple categories is beneficial in that IFM out-performed both AFM and PFM models on various tasks. However, the relative performance of the IFM models depends on the specific prediction task; so, experimenters facing a novel task should engage in some measure of model selection.","Stanford University, CA, United States; Carnegie Mellon University, PA, United States; University of Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Arizona State University, AZ, United States","Chi, M. and Koedinger, K. and Gordon, G. and Jordan, P. and VanLehn, K.",,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 24,,61-70,Scopus,Instructional factors analysis: A cognitive model for multiple instructional interventions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857471334&partnerID=40&md5=515fa0cd8fec1a4ce94ff9308078691c,2011
conference,Gowda2011199,"Over the past several years, several extensions to Bayesian knowledge tracing have been proposed in order to improve predictions of students' in-tutor and post-test performance. One such extension is Contextual Guess and Slip, which incorporates machine-learned models of students' guess and slip behaviors in order to enhance the overall model's predictive performance [Baker et al. 2008a]. Similar machine learning approaches have been introduced in order to detect specific problem-solving steps during which students most likely learned particular skills [Baker, Goldstein, and Heffernan in press]. However, one important class of features that have not been considered in machine learning models used in these two techniques is metrics of item and skill difficulty, a key type of feature in other assessment frameworks [e.g Hambleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers, 1991; Pavlik, Cen, & Koedinger 2009]. In this paper, a set of engineered features that quantify skill difficulty and related skill-level constructs are investigated in terms of their ability to improve models of guessing, slipping, and detecting moment-by-moment learning. Supervised machine learning models that have been trained using the new skill-difficulty features are compared to models from the original contextual guess and slip and moment-by-moment learning detector work.

conference,Vuong2011211,"Creating an educational curriculum is a difficult task involving many variables and constraints [Wang 2005]. In any curriculum, the order of the instructional units is partly based on which units teach prerequisite knowledge for later units. Historically, psychologists and cognitive scientists have studied the dependency structure of information in various domains [Bergan and Jeska 1980; Griffiths and Grant 1985; Chi and Koeske 1983]; however, many of these studies have been hampered by statistical issues such as the difficulty of removing instructional effects when using small samples [Horne 1983]. We hypothesize that large-scale assessment data can be analyzed to determine the dependency relationships between units in a curriculum. This structure could then be used in generating and evaluating alternate unit sequences to test whether omitting or re-ordering units would undermine necessary foundational knowledge building. Our method incorporates all possible pair-wise dependency relationships in a curriculum and, for each such candidate dependency, compares performance of students who used the potential prerequisite unit to performance of students who did not. We implemented the method on a random sample of schools from across the U.S. that use Carnegie Learning's Cognitive Tutor software and its associated curricula; a sample that far exceeds those used in previous studies both in size and in scope. The resulting structure is compared to a pre-existing list of prerequisites created by Carnegie Learning based on student skill models. We discuss extensions of this method, issues in interpreting the results, and possible applications. We hope that this work serves as a step toward developing a data-driven model of curriculum design.","Carnegie Learning, INC., 437 Grant St., Pittsburgh,PA 15219, United States","Vuong, A. and Nixon, T. and Towle, B.",Curriculum;  Data mining;  Intelligent tutor,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 34,,211-215,Scopus,A method for finding prerequisites within a curriculum,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857468767&partnerID=40&md5=b189cfc5a4d916223bc252e5c7379963,2011

Observing affect further will help us understand the transitions between learning and non-learning activities when students learn online. To achieve this, we collected affect and activity transition data from students learning online at home. D'Mello's likelihood metric was modified to compute the likelihood of transitioning between activities and their corresponding affective states. Results showed that students not only shift to non-learning activities after experiencing negative affective states, but also positive affective states plausibly when learning goals are completed.

conference,Wauters2011247,"Adaptive item sequencing is a well-established adaptation technique for personalizing learning environments and can be achieved through an intense reciprocity between the item difficulty level and the learner's proficiency. Consequently, the need to monitor learners' proficiency level is of great importance. On that account, researchers have brought forward the Elo rating system. While the Elo rating system has its origin in chess, it has proven its value during its short history in the educational setting. Elo's algorithm implies that the rating after an event is function of the pre-event rating, the weight given to the new observation and the difference between the new observed score and the expected score. It seems reasonable to adapt the weight of Elo's algorithm as function of the number of observations: the more previous observations we have, the more certain we are about the learner's proficiency estimate, and the less this estimate should be affected by a new observation. The aim of this paper is to search for weights as a function of the number of previous observations that results in optimally accurate proficiency estimates, making use of a real data set. Results indicate that the Elo algorithm with a logistic weight function better approximates the parameter estimates obtained with the item response theory than the Elo algorithm with a fixed weight.","Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, ITEC/IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium; Faculty of Arts, ITEC/IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium","Wauters, K. and Desmet, P. and Noortgate, W.",Elo rating;  IRT;  Proficiency,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 6,,247-251,Scopus,Monitoring learners' proficiency: Weight adaptation in the Elo rating system,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857467666&partnerID=40&md5=2e7bd1cd30fd32e75d24f096d5904c23,2011

Standard classifiers take as input a feature vector and output its predicted label. It is possible to formulate tutorial dialogue classification problems in this way.

To take into account the sequential effect, this work proposes a novel approach which uses tensor factorization for forecasting student performance. With this approach, we can personalize the prediction for each student given the task, thus, it can also be used for recommending the tasks to the students.

conference,Martinez2011111,"Electronic traces of activity have the potential to be an invaluable source to understand the strategies followed by groups of learners working collaboratively around a tabletop. However, in tabletop and other co-located learning settings, high amounts of unconstrained actions can be performed by different students simultaneously. This paper introduces a data mining approach that exploits the log traces of a problem-solving tabletop application to extract patterns of activity in order to shed light on the strategies followed by groups of learners. The objective of the data mining task is to discover which frequent sequences of actions differentiate high achieving from low achieving groups. An important challenge is to interpret the raw log traces, taking the user identification into account, and pre-process this data to make it suitable for mining and discovering meaningful patterns of interaction. We explore two methods for mining sequential patterns. We compare these two methods by evaluating the information that they each discover about the strategies followed by the high and low achieving groups. Our key contributions include the design of an approach to find frequent sequential patterns from multiuser co-located settings, the evaluation of the two methods, and the analysis of the results obtained from the sequential pattern mining.","School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia; Faculty of Information Science and Technology, UKM, Malaysia; School of Computing Science, Newcastle University, United Kingdom","Martinez, R. and Yacef, K. and Kay, J. and Al-Qaraghuli, A. and Kharrufa, A.",Collaborative learning;  Hierarchical clustering;  Interactive tabletops;  Sequence mining,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 48,,111-120,Scopus,Analysing frequent sequential patterns of collaborative learning activity around an interactive tabletop,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857463622&partnerID=40&md5=a53539b51faa32292bb1907328119886,2011

conference,Worsley2011234,"Assessing student learning across a variety of environments and tasks continues to be a crucial educational concern. This task is of particular difficulty in non-traditional learning environments where students endeavor to design their own projects and engage in a hands-on educational experience. In order to improve our ability to recognize learning in these constructionist environments, this paper reports on an exploratory analysis of learning through multiple modalities: speech, sentiment and drawing. A rich set of features is automatically extracted from the data and used to identify emergent markers of expertise. Some of the most prominent markers of expertise include: user certainty, the ability to describe things efficiently and a disinclination to use unnecessary descriptors or qualifiers. Experts also displayed better organization and used less detail in their drawings. While many of these are things one would expect of an expert, there were areas in which experts looked very similar to novices. To explain this we report on learning theories that can reconcile these seemingly odd findings, and expound on how these domain-independent markers can be useful for identifying student learning over a series of activities.","Stanford University, United States",Worsley and Blikstein,Assessment;  Learning Analytics;  Multi-modal;  Speech,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 24,,234-239,Scopus,"What's an expert?

We looked at KTs predictions on student responses where a day or more had elapsed smce the previous response and found that KT consistently over predicted these data points in particular. We made two hypotheses to explain the over prediction behavior: 1) the student forgot since the last time on the tutor and 2) the student made a mistake (or slipped) on that first question of the day. We developed two models: KT-Forget and KT-$hp. modifications on Knowledge Tracing, to represent these two hypotheses. We evaluated and compared the performance of the KT-slip. KT-Forget and regular KT model by calculating prediction residuals and Area Under Curve (AUC) on a Cognitive Tutor and ASSISTments dataset. The results showed that a significant improvement was obtained on the overall prediction by our KT-Forget model, suggesting that forgetting is the more likely cognitive explanation for the data and that there is a place for modeling forgetting, something that has not common practice in student modeling.","Department of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States","Qiu, Y. and Ql, Y. and Lu, H. and Pardos, Z.A. and Heffernan, N.T.",Bayesian Network;  Data Mining;  Intelligent Tutormg Systems;  Knowledge Tracing;  Model Evaluation,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 25,,139-148,Scopus,Does time matter?

The idea is to develop ""pedagogical agents"" that monitor learner behaviour through the actions they perform and identify patterns that point to systematic behaviour, or lack thereof. To achieve these aims, it is necessary to develop methods to identify relevant patterns, and to associate these patterns with feedback to the learner. Here, we present a tool, called Brick, in which pedagogical researchers can interactively specify global patterns (e.g., ""which actions occur between running a simulation and providing a correct answer""). The tool then responds with the matching sub-sequences in the data along with various metrics of interestingness (such as frequency and likelihood). Researchers can then determine which patterns are relevant to include in a pedagogical agent and how the agent should respond when a pattern occurs. We describe the tool, the pattern language and metrics used, and provide examples of applying these to log files of a simulation-based inquiry learning environment.","University of Twente, PO Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; Leiden University, PO Box 9555, 2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","Anjewierden, A. and Gijlers, H. and Saab, N. and De Hoog, R.",,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 5,,341-342,Scopus,Brick: Mining pedagogically interesting sequential patterns,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857460046&partnerID=40&md5=3ef8a54d99c5ca2385bd3222cb585958,2011

There have recently been several empirical comparisons as to which types of student models are better at predicting future performance, both within and outside of the interactive learning environment. A recent paper (Baker et al., in press) considers whether ensembling can produce better prediction than individual models, when ensembling is performed at the level of predictions of performance within the tutor. However, better performance was not achieved for predicting the post-test. In this paper, we investigate ensembling at the post-test level, to see if this approach can produce better prediction of post-test scores within the context of a Cognitive Tutor for Genetics.

conference,Wauters2011121,"The evolution from static to dynamic electronic learning environments has stimulated the research on adaptive item sequencing. A prerequisite for adaptive item sequencing, in which the difficulty of the item is constantly matched to the knowledge level of the learner is to have items with a known difficulty level. The difficulty level can be estimated by means of the item response theory (IRT), as often done prior to computerized adaptive testing. However, the requirement of this calibration method is not easily met in many practical learning situations, for instance, due to the cost of prior calibration and due to continuous generation of new learning items. The aim of this paper is to search for alternative estimation methods and to review the accuracy of these methods as compared to IRT-based calibration. Using real data, six estimation methods are compared with IRT-based calibration: proportion correct, learner feedback, expert rating, paired comparison (learner), paired comparison (expert) and the Elo rating system. Results indicate that proportion correct has the strongest relation with IRT-based difficulty estimates, followed by learner feedback, the Elo rating system, expert rating and finally paired comparison.","Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, ITEC/IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium; Faculty of Arts, ITEC/IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium","Wauters, K. and Desmet, P. and Van Den Noortgate, W.",Expert rating;  Graded response model and Elo rating;  IRT;  Learner feedback;  Paired comparison;  Proportion correct,Conference Paper,,EDM 2011 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 9,,121-127,Scopus,Acquiring item difficulty estimates: A collaborative effort of data and judgment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857459371&partnerID=40&md5=c0f5caef9dbff9fe4b01bf5a885a2793,2011

For both of these goals, having high model accuracy is important, and researchers have incorporated a variety of features into student models. However, since different techniques use various features, when evaluating those approaches, we could not easily figure out what is key for a high predictive accuracy: the model or the features. In this paper, to establish such knowledge, we performed empirical studies varying which features the models considered such as items, skills, and transfer models. We found that item difficulty is a better predictor than skill difficulty or student proficiencies on the transfer model. Moreover, we evaluated two versions of the PFA model; the one with item difficulty resulted in slightly higher predictive accuracy than the one with skill difficulty. In addition, prior work has shown that considering student overall proficiencies, not just those thought to be important by the transfer model, works substantially better on ASSISTments data.

A similar performance suggests that the simulated data is more faithful to the real data than for a dissimilar performace.

Thus we show some relevant results obtained when comparing several frequent and rare association rule mining algorithms. We also offer some illustrative examples of the rules discovered in order to demonstrate both their performance and their usefulness in educational environments.","Dept. of Computer Science, University of Córdoba, Spain","Romero, C. and Romero, J.R. and Luna, J.M. and Ventura, S.",,Conference Paper,,Educational Data Mining 2010 - 3rd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 62,,171-180,Scopus,Mining rare association rules from e-learning data,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857491217&partnerID=40&md5=b584da96378235832660f7ddea693332,2010

conference,Yudelson2010221,"Nowadays, it is a common practice to use several educational systems in one domain. In this situation, each of the systems should be able to provide the best user modeling based on the integrated data about the user. However, differences in domain conceptualization complicate the ability of the systems to understand each other's user models and necessitate the use of labor intensive and time consuming alignment procedures that require involvement of knowledge engineers. While the latter are best at detecting associative links between the user model items, they fail to reliably identify the strengths of these associations. In this paper, we are proposing a method to improve the user model mapping by using a numerical optimization procedure. Our results show that numerical weight optimization helped to decrease the amount of manual work and improved the target model accuracy.","School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, United States; Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, New Zealand","Yudelson, M. and Brusilovsky, P. and Mitrovic, A. and Mathews, M.",,Conference Paper,,Educational Data Mining 2010 - 3rd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 2,,221-230,Scopus,Using numeric optimization to refine semantic user model integration of educational systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857488273&partnerID=40&md5=546dddd9bb2c4552c8df8ce62d7fb5dc,2010

conference,Feng201041,"Dynamic assessment (DA) has been advocated as an interactive approach to conduct assessments to students in the learning systems as it can differentiate student proficiency at a finer grained level. Sternberg and others have been pursuing an alternative to IQ tests. They proposed to give students tests to see how much assistance it takes a student to learn a topic; and to use as a measure of their learning gain. They referred to this as dynamic assessment. It was suggested that this assisting-while-testing procedure could be done well by computer. To researchers in the intelligent tutoring system community, it comes as no surprise that measuring how much assistance a student needs to complete a task successfully is probably a good indicator of this lack of knowledge. However, a cautionary note is that conducting DA takes more time than simply administering regular test items to students. In this paper, we report a study analyzing 40-minutes data of 1,392 students from two school years using educational data mining techniques. We compare two conditions: one contains only practice items without intervention while the other condition allows students to seek for help when they encounter difficulties. The result suggests that for the purpose of assessing student performance, it is more efficient for students to take DA than just having practice items.","SRI International, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA 01609, United States","Feng, M. and Heffernan, N.",Assessment in learning system;  Dynamic assessment,Conference Paper,,Educational Data Mining 2010 - 3rd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 7,,41-50,Scopus,Can we get better assessment from a tutoring system compared to traditional paper testing? can we have our cake (better assessment) and eat it too (student learning during the test)?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857473060&partnerID=40&md5=25508c7346b2390577ded3df29f88711,2010

conference,Pardos2010161,"Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (KT) models are employed by the cognitive tutors in order to determine student knowledge based on four parameters: learn rate, prior, guess and slip. A commonly used algorithm for learning these parameter values from data is the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Past work, however, has suggested that with four free parameters the standard KT model is prone to converging to erroneous degenerate states depending on the initial values of these four parameters. In this work we simulate data from a model with known parameter values and then run a grid search over the parameter initialization space of KT to map out which initial values lead to erroneous learned parameters. Through analysis of convergence and error surface visualizations we found that the initial parameter values leading to a degenerate state are not scattered randomly throughput the parameter space but instead exist on a surface with predictable boundaries. A recently introduced extension to KT that individualizes the prior parameter is also explored and compared to standard KT with regard to parameter convergence. We found that the individualization model has unique properties which allow it to avoid the local maxima problem.","Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States","Pardos, Z.A. and Heffernan, N.T.",,Conference Paper,,Educational Data Mining 2010 - 3rd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 33,,161-170,Scopus,Navigating the parameter space of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing models: Visualizations of the convergence of the expectation maximization algorithm,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857464600&partnerID=40&md5=c9ea9529d6605d9fb4caaebccb4513a0,2010
conference,D'mello201031,"We investigated 28 learners' postural patterns associated with naturally occurring episodes of boredom, flow/engagement, confusion, frustration, and delight during a tutoring session with AutoTutor, a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system. Training and validation data were collected in a learning session with AutoTutor, after which the learners' affective states (i.e., emotions) were rated by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges. An automated body pressure measurement system was used to capture the pressure exerted by the learner on the seat and back of a chair during the tutoring session. We extracted 16 posture-related features that focused on the pressure exerted along with the magnitude and direction of changes in pressure during emotional experiences. Binary logistic regression models yielded medium sized effects in discriminating the affective states from neutral. An analysis of the parameters of the models indicated that the affective states were manifested by three unique postural configurations and a general increase in movement (when compared to neutral).","Institute for Intelligent Systems, University of Memphis, United States","D'mello, S. and Graesser, A.",,Conference Paper,,Educational Data Mining 2010 - 3rd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 17,,31-40,Scopus,Mining bodily patterns of affective experience during learning,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857462254&partnerID=40&md5=89fba0f8a50a781a9f9c3a5ba2f0ffb4,2010

Knowledge tracing, the most commonly used approach, suffers from local maxima and multiple global maxima. Prior work has shown that using Dirichlet priors improves model parameter plausibility.

To address this problem, this paper presents an approach to integrate multiple distributions and Dirichlet priors. We show that modeling groups of students separately based on their distributional similarities produces model parameters that provide a more plausible picture of student knowledge, even though the proposed solution did not improve the model's predictive accuracy.

conference,Rai2009141,"Student modeling is a widely used approach to make inference about a student's attributes like knowledge, learning, etc. If we wish to use these models to analyze and better understand student learning there are two problems. First, a model's ability to predict student performance is at best weakly related to the accuracy of any one of its parameters. Second, a commonly used student modeling technique, knowledge tracing, suffers from having multiple sets of parameters providing equally good model fits. Furthermore, common methods for estimating parameters, including conjugate gradient descent and expectation maximization, suffer from finding local maxima that are heavily dependent on their starting values. We propose a technique that estimates Dirichlet priors directly from the data, and show that using those priors produces model parameters that provide a more plausible picture of student knowledge.

Only log files that record students' actions with the system are used to train the model, therefore the modeling process doesn't require expert knowledge for identifying domain specific skills that are needed to solve the problem or students' possible solution methods etc. The model utilizes a set of performance features, problem features, time and mouse movement features and is compared to i) a model that utilizes performance and problem features, ii) a model that uses performance, problem and time features. In order to address data sparseness problem, a robust Ridge Regression algorithm is designed to estimate model parameters.

Besides, the complexity of these tasks increases when they involve more than one lecturer. Reaching an agreement about the criteria and the levels of proficiency might be easier taking into account the abilities students must achieve according to the purpose of the subject. However, the disagreement about the weights of every criterion in an assessment rubric might easily appear. This paper focuses on the automatic weight adjustment for the criteria of a rubric. This fitting can be considered as a global perception that the whole group of lecturers have about the accuracy of solving an activity. Firstly, each lecturer makes a proposal of weights and then, from a set of pairs of students he/she globally expresses who of each pair has solved better the activity for which the rubric was designed. Secondly, an approach based on the pairwise learning is proposed in this work to obtain adequate weights for the criteria of a rubric.

Specifically, we are interested in seeing whether we can evaluate schools by examining the grain-size at which its students are best represented. Also, we are curious about whether different types of students are best represented by different transfer models. We found that better schools and stronger students are best represented by models with a fewer number of skills. Weaker students and schools are best represented, for our data, by models that allow no transfer of knowledge in between skills. Perhaps surprisingly, to accurately predict the level at which a student represents knowledge it is sufficient to know his standardized test score rather than indicators of socio economic status or his school.","Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States","Feng, M. and Beck, J.",,Conference Paper,,EDM'09 - Educational Data Mining 2009: 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 6,,240-249,Scopus,Back to the future: A non-automated method of constructing transfer models,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77958154295&partnerID=40&md5=7fac417d0c14af4c439b305cf3b02fd3,2009

The majority of data collected in many ITS systems consist of answers to a group of questions of a given skill often presented in a random sequence. Following work that identifies which items produce the most learning we propose a Bayesian method using similar permutation analysis techniques to determine if item learning is context sensitive and if so which orderings of questions produce the most learning. We confine our analysis to random sequences with three questions. The method identifies question ordering rules such as, question A should go before B, which are statistically reliably beneficial to learning. Real tutor data from five random sequence problem sets were analyzed. Statistically reliable orderings of questions were found in two of the five real data problem sets. A simulation consisting of 140 experiments was run to validate the method's accuracy and test its reliability. The method succeeded in finding 43% of the underlying item order effects with a 6% false positive rate using a p value threshold of <= 0.05. Using this method, ITS researchers can gain valuable knowledge about their problem sets and feasibly let the ITS automatically identify item order effects and optimize student learning by restricting assigned sequences to those prescribed as most beneficial to learning.","National Science Foundation, United States; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States","Pardos, Z.A. and Heffernan, N.T.",,Conference Paper,,EDM'09 - Educational Data Mining 2009: 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 15,,111-120,Scopus,Determining the significance of item order in randomized problem sets,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77958154234&partnerID=40&md5=0c21ac7f0048f1a536f4a35bb4d8abcb,2009

The presented technique has been tested on real data coming from pedagogical tests focused on evaluation of mathematical skills of secondary school students in Czech Republic. The results show that the proposed tool provides comprehensible representation of the data.,"Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Pedagogical Faculty, University of Ostrava, Českobratrská 16, 701 03 Ostrava, Czech Republic","Zoubek, L. and Burda, M.",,Conference Paper,,EDM'09 - Educational Data Mining 2009: 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining,cited By 6,,315-324,Scopus,Visualization of differences in data measuring mathematical skills,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77958150166&partnerID=40&md5=d5227194806993705181ae491f009475,2009

By using a pairwise test to search for the relationships between learning curves for these item-types, we show how the test results in a set of pairwise transfer relationships that can be expressed in a Q-matrix domain model. Creating these Q-matrices for various test criteria we show that the new domain model results in consistently better learning curve fits as shown by crossvalidation. Further, the Q-matrices produced can be used by educators or curriculum designers to gain a richer, more integrated perspective on concepts in the domain.

In this work, we look to see if students were reliably learning from their time spent with the computer in a single day. Our result suggests that students performed better later in the same computer session on similar skills, which indicates students are learning from using ASSISTments.

conference,Merceron200857,"Educational data differs from traditional knowledge discovery domains in several ways. One of them is the fact that it is difficult, or even impossible, to compare different methods or measures a posteriori and deduce which the best is. It is therefore essential to use techniques and measurements that are fairly intuitive and easy to interpret. Extracting the most interesting association rules can be quite tricky. One of the difficulties is that many measures of interestingness do not work effectively for all datasets and are hard to understand intuitively by the teachers. We argue in this paper that cosine and added value (or equivalently lift) are well suited to educational data, and that teachers can interpret their results easily. We argue that interestingness should be checked with cosine first, and then with lift if cosine rates the rule as noninteresting. If both measures disagree, teachers should use the intuition behind the measures to decide whether or not to dismiss the association rule.

conference,Desmarais200848,"Bayesian graphical models are commonly used to build student models from data. A number of standard algorithms are available to train Bayesian models from student skills assessment data. These models can assess student knowledge and skills from a few observations. They are useful for Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), for example, where the test items can be administered in order to maximize the information they will provide. In practice, such data often contains missing values and, under some circumstances, missing values far outnumber observed values. However, when collecting data from test results, one can often choose which values will be present or missing by a consequent test design. We study how to optimize the choice of test items for collecting the data that will be used for training a Bayesian CAT model, such as to maximize the predictive performance of the model. We explore the use of a simple heuristic for test item choice based on the level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of an item is derived from its initial probability of success and, thus, from its difficulty. The results show that this choice does affect model performance and that the heuristic can lead to better performance. Although the study's results are more exploratory than conclusive, they suggest interesting research avenues.","Computer and Software Engineering Department, Polytechnique Montŕeal, Canada","Desmarais, M.C. and Villarreal, A. and Gagnon, M.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 4,,48-56,Scopus,Adaptive test design with a naive bayes framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857479395&partnerID=40&md5=5770bbb9eb742c134e8657b5508c86fb,2008

conference,Mathews2008266,"Active engagement in the subject material has been strongly linked to deeper learning. In traditional teaching environments, even though the student might be presented with new concepts, it is possible for the student to remain passive to such an extent that it is detrimental to learning. This research explores whether experiencing new concepts in an ITS necessarily equates to learning. Initial analysis of data mining student models in SQL-Tutor, a CBM tutor, shows a strong positive correlation between the number of constraints seen and the number of constraints learned. This global trend is mitigated at an individual level, possibly due to individual differences in learning style and behavior. The number of constraints not learned remains relatively constant for all students; however, the proportion of constraints not learned is inversely proportional to the constraints seen.

Analyzing covariance is important because it allows us to place the skills in a related network in which we can identify the role each skill plays in learning the overall domain. This placement allows more effective and automatic assignment of skills to item-types. To analyze covariance we used POKS (partial order knowledge structures) to analyze item-type outcome relationships and Pearson correlation to capture item-type duration relationships. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of these item-types was also performed using both outcome and duration covariance patterns. These analyses allowed us to propose improved skill labeling that removes irrelevant item-types, clusters related types, and clarifies the optimal temporal ordering of these clusters during practice.","Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, United States; Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University, United States","Pavlik, P.I. and Cen, H. and Wu, L. and Koedinger, K.R.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 15,,77-86,Scopus,Using Item-type Performance Covariance to Improve the Skill Model of an Existing Tutor,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953016786&partnerID=40&md5=b740a41bd008b8a8716402f2929d6d5c,2008
conference,Ayers2008210,"In educational research, a fundamental goal is identifying which skills students have mastered, which skills they have not, and which skills they are in the process of mastering. As the number of examinees, items, and skills increases, the estimation of even simple cognitive diagnosis models becomes dificult. To address this, we introduce a capability matrix showing for each skill the proportion correct on all items tried by each student involving that skill. We apply variations of common clustering methods to this matrix and discuss conditioning on sparse subspaces. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our method on several simulated datasets and illustrate the dificulties inherent in real data using a subset of online mathematics tutor data. We also comment on the interpretability and application of the results for teachers.","Department of Statistics, Carnegie Mellon University, United States; Department of Statistics, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom","Ayers, E. and Nugent, R. and Dean, N.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 24,,210-217,Scopus,Skill set profile clustering based on student capability vectors computed from online tutoring data,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953004435&partnerID=40&md5=9039ce0770277c9b49900bdf84926b0c,2008
conference,Hershkovitz2008226,"The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework and a tool for measuring motivation of online learners. The study was carried out in three phases, the first of which was the construction of a framework, based on an extensive literature review. Phase two consisted of identifying variables computable from log file data, associate with the framework and compatible with previous empirical research. For this purpose, an empirical study was designed and a specific learning environment focusing on vocabulary for adults was chosen. Log files of a large population (N=2,162) were collected and variables were identified using Learnograms, a visual representation of learning variables over time. This phase resulted in seven explicitly defined variables, along with a mechanism to calculate them from the raw log files. The third phase included preprocessing of the dataset (reducing it to 674 cases) and application of hierarchical clustering of the variables. This phase resulted in three clusters interpreted to fit the three dimensions of motivation defined in the framework. A discussion of this study and further research is provided.","Knowledge Technology Lab, School of Education, Tel Aviv University, Israel","Hershkovitz, A. and Nachmias, R.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 24,,226-233,Scopus,Developing a log-based motivation measuring tool,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957280754&partnerID=40&md5=8a9af51707a2e1804fc4a5cef5f455de,2008

We show that the methodology of constrained pattern mining used can solve this problem in a way that is difficult to achieve with other approaches.","Dep of Computer Science and Engineering, Instituto Superior Técnico, Av.

conference,Baker200838,"We present text replays, a method for generating labels that can be used to train classifiers of student behavior. We use this method to label data as to whether students are gaming the system, within 20 intelligent tutor units on Algebra. Text replays are 2-6 times faster per label than previous methods for generating labels, such as quantitative field observations and screen replays; however, being able to generate classifiers on retrospective data at the coder's convenience (rather than being dependent on visits to schools) makes this method about 40 times faster than quantitative field observations. Text replays also give precise predictions of student behavior at multiple grain-sizes, allowing the use of both hierarchical classifiers such as Latent Response Models (LRMs), and non-hierarchical classifiers such as Decision Trees. Training using text replay data appears to lead to better classifiers: LRMs trained using text replay data achieve higher correlation and A' than LRMs trained using quantitative field observations; Decision Trees are more precise than LRMs at identifying exactly when the behavior occurs.","Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, United States","Baker, R.S.J.D. and De Carvalho, A.M.J.A.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 44,,38-47,Scopus,Labeling student behavior faster and more precisely with text replays,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949587109&partnerID=40&md5=760dbff7920de6226316814863656c02,2008
conference,Pardos2008147,"Multi skill scenarios are common place in real world problems and Intelligent Tutoring System questions alike, however, system designers have often relied on ad-hoc methods for modeling the composition of multiple skills. There are two common approaches to determining the probability of correct for a multi skill question: a conjunctive approach, which assumes that all skills must be known or a compensatory approach which assumes that the strength of one skill can compensate for the weakness of another skill. We compare the conjunctive model to a learned compositional function and find that the learned function quite nearly converges to the conjunctive function. We can confidently report that system designers can implement the AND gate to represent the composition function quite accurately. Cognitive modelers may be interested in the small compensatory effect that is present. We use a static Bayesian network to model the two hypotheses and use the expectation-maximization algorithm to learn the parameters of the models.","Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States","Pardos, Z.A. and Beck, J.E. and Ruiz, C. and Heffernan, N.T.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 20,,147-156,Scopus,The composition effect: Conjunctive or compensatory?

conference,Allevato2008167,"Programs that perform automated assignment grading can generate a great deal of meaningful data not only for the student, but for the instructor as well. Such tools are often used in computer science courses to assess student programming work. In the process of grading, a large amount of intermediate information is gathered. However, in most cases this information is not used beyond assigning scores, so the potential of learning more about the course is lost. At the same time, continuous collection of data over a large number of submissions across many courses presents an interesting but untapped resource for educational data mining. One solution to this problem is to implement a reporting tool for making use of this intermediate data to create meaningful interpretations. This paper describes how an automated grading system, Web- CAT, has been extended to provide a reporting mechanism that uses the intermediate data that is gathered during assessment of students' programs. Our implementation of the reporting tool makes use of the Business Information Reporting Tool (BIRT) developed for the Eclipse IDE.","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, United States","Allevato, A. and Thornton, M. and Edwards, S.H. and Pérez-Quiñones, M.A.",,Conference Paper,,"Educational Data Mining 2008 - 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, Proceedings",cited By 11,,167-176,Scopus,Mining data from an automated grading and testing system by adding rich reporting capabilities,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70449698753&partnerID=40&md5=638d413b9ec68bfe672408b7eeff6241,2008

To extend our previous work, we propose a new method of using students test scores from multiple years (referred to as cross-year data) for determining whether a student model is as good as the standardized test to which it is compared at estimating student math proficiency. We show that our model can do as well as a standardized test. We show that what we assess has prediction ability two years later.
