While extracting the whole concept graph from a textbook is our final goal, the focus of this paper is the identification of the propaedeutic relations among concepts. To this aim, we employ a method based on burst analysis and co-occurrence which recognizes, by means of temporal reasoning, prerequisite relations among concepts that share intense periods in the text.

Despite some shared metrics and research questions, researchers in this area have some differences in how they pre-process the data for analysis [17]. Specifically, researchers differ in how they treat cases where a student remains in the same affective state in two successive observations, referred to as self-transitions. While most researchers include these cases in their data, D\u2019Mello and others have argued over the last few years that these cases should be removed prior to analysis. While this choice reflects the intended focus in their research paradigm on the transitions out of an affective state, this difference in data preprocessing changes the meaning of the metric used. For around a decade, the community has used the metric L to evaluate the probability of transitions in affect. L is largely believed to have a value of 0 when a transition is at chance, and this is true for the original use of the metric. However, this paper provides mathematical evidence that this metric does not have a value of 0 at chance if self-transitions are removed. This shift is problematic because previously published statistical analyses comparing L values to the value at chance have used the wrong value, incorrectly producing lowered p values and in many cases reporting transitions as significantly more likely than chance when they are actually less frequent.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23204-7_16.json", "data": {"article-title": "How Many Times Should a Pedagogical Agent Simulation Model Be Run?", "author": [{"author-name": "David Edgar K.

One of the most important decisions has to do with determining how many runs of a simulation to perform in order to be confident in the results produced by the simulation [1]. With a deterministic model, a single simulation run is adequate. This issue becomes more challenging when part of the simulation model is based on stochastic elements. One of the solutions that has been used to address this challenge in other research communities is the use of Monte Carlo simulation [2]. Within the AIED research community, however, this question of how many times should a pedagogical simulation model be run to produce predictions in which the designer can have confidence has received surprisingly little attention. The aim of this paper is to explore this issue using a pedagogical simulation model, SimDoc, designed to explore longer term mentoring issues [3]. In particular, we demonstrate how to run this simulation model over many iterations until the accumulated results of the iteration runs reach a statistically stable level that matches real world performance but also has appropriate variability among the runs. We believe this approach generalizes beyond our simulation environment and could be applied to other pedagogical simulations and would be especially useful for medium and high fidelity simulations where each run may take a long time."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23204-7_17.json", "data": {"article-title": "A Survey of the General Public\u2019s Views on the Ethics of Using AI in Education", "author": [{"author-name": "Annabel Latham", "affiliation": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, {"author-name": "Sean Goltz", "affiliation": "Edith Cowan University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 194-206", "keywords": ["Ethics", "Trust", "GDPR"], "citation": "Latham A., Goltz S.

For example, teachable agents can provide socio-emotional support to learners, influencing learner self-efficacy and motivation, and increasing learning. Prior work has found that a teachable agent which engages learners socially through social dialogue and paraverbal adaptation on pitch can have positive effects on rapport and learning. In this work, we introduce Emma, a teachable robotic agent that can speak socially and adapt on both pitch and loudness. Based on the phenomenon of entrainment, multi-feature adaptation on tone and loudness has been found in human-human interactions to be highly correlated to learning and social engagement. In a study with 48 middle school participants, we performed a novel exploration of how multi-feature adaptation can influence learner rapport and learning as an independent social behavior and combined with social dialogue. We found significantly more rapport for Emma when the robot both adapted and spoke socially than when Emma only adapted and indications of a similar trend for learning. Additionally, it appears that an individual\u2019s initial comfort level with robots may influence how they respond to such behavior, suggesting that for individuals who are more comfortable interacting with robots, social behavior may have a more positive influence.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23204-7_21.json", "data": {"article-title": "A Concept Map Based Assessment of Free Student Answers in Tutorial Dialogues", "author": [{"author-name": "Nabin Maharjan", "affiliation": "The University of Memphis"}, {"author-name": "Vasile Rus", "affiliation": "The University of Memphis"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 244-257", "keywords": ["Concept map", "Student answer assessment", "Tutorial dialogues", "Intelligent tutoring system", "Student knowledge representation", "semantic textual similarity", "Interpretable similarity"], "citation": "Maharjan N., Rus V.

The approach relies on a novel tuple extraction method to automatically map student responses to concept maps. Using tuples as the unit of learning (learning components) allows us to track students\u2019 knowledge at a finer grain level. We can thus better assess student answers beyond the binary decision of correct and incorrect as we can also identify partially-correct student answers. Moreover, our approach can easily detect missing learning components in student answers.

While much research has focused on helping students make sense of visuals, students also have to become perceptually fluent at translating among visuals fast and effortlessly. Because perceptual fluency is acquired via implicit, nonverbal processes, perceptual fluency trainings provide simple classification tasks that vary visual features across numerous examples. Prior research shows that learning from such trainings is strongly affected by the sequence of the examples. Further, prior research shows that perceptual fluency trainings are most effective for high-performing students but may confuse low-performing students. We propose that a lack of benefits for low-performing students may result from a perceptual expert blind spot of instructors who typically develop perceptual fluency trainings: expert instructors may be unable to anticipate the needs of students who do not see meaningful information in the visuals. In prior work, we used a machine-learning approach to develop a sequence of example visuals of chemical molecules for low-performing students.

We determined students\u2019 performance based on log data from an educational technology they used in the course.

Prior research has shown that studying erroneous examples can increase students\u2019 experiences of confrustion, while at the same time helping them learn and overcome their misconceptions. In the study reported in this paper, we examined students\u2019 knowledge and misconceptions about decimal numbers before and after they interacted with an intelligent tutoring system presenting either erroneous examples targeting misconceptions (erroneous example condition) or practice problems targeting the same misconceptions (problem-solving condition). While students in both conditions significantly improved their performance from pretest to posttest, students in the problem-solving condition improved significantly more and experienced significantly less confrustion. When controlling for confrustion levels, there were no differences in performance. This study is interesting in that, unlike prior studies, the higher confrustion that resulted from studying erroneous examples was not associated with better learning outcomes; instead, it was associated with poorer learning. We propose several possible explanations for this different outcome and hypothesize that revisions to the explanation prompts to make them more expert-like may have also made them \u2013 and the erroneous examples that they targeted \u2013 less understandable and less effective.

Recent NLP research has introduced novel deep learning architectures such as the Transformer, which merely uses self-attention mechanisms. Pre-trained models based on the Transformer architecture have been used to produce impressive results across a range of NLP tasks. In this work, we experiment with fine-tuning a pre-trained self-attention language model, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) applying it to short answer grading, and show that it produces superior results across multiple domains. On the benchmarking dataset of SemEval-2013, we report up to 10% absolute improvement in macro-average-F1 over state-of-the-art results. On our two psychology domain datasets, the fine-tuned model yields classification almost up to the human-agreement levels. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of fine-tuning as a function of the size of the task-specific labeled data, the number of training epochs, and its generalizability to cross-domain and join-domain scenarios.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23204-7_4.json", "data": {"article-title": "The Impact of Student Model Updates on Contingent Scaffolding in a Natural-Language Tutoring System", "author": [{"author-name": "Patricia Albacete", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh"}, {"author-name": "Pamela Jordan", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh"}, {"author-name": "Sandra Katz", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh"}, {"author-name": "Irene Angelica Chounta", "affiliation": "University of Tartu"}, {"author-name": "Bruce M.

One remaining difficulty, however, is that measurement accuracy is reduced when few raters are assigned to each essay, a common situation in practical testing contexts.

Provision of performance feedback is essential to enable skill acquisition by ensuring that mistakes are identified and corrected, strengths are reinforced, and insights into consequences of actions are provided. As such, for a simulation system to be an effective training platform and to enable self-directed learning, it is imperative that automated performance feedback is provided by the system. Although there has been increased interest in the development of feedback methodologies in VR-based surgical training in recent years, their effectiveness in practice has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we investigate the impact of performance feedback in a VR-based surgical training platform with respect to skill acquisition and retention through a randomized controlled trial.

Overall, these findings suggest that adaptive scaffolding may support students\u2019 inquiry learning and transfer of inquiry practices over time and across topics."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23207-8_32.json", "data": {"article-title": "Automatic Short Answer Grading via Multiway Attention Networks", "author": [{"author-name": "Tiaoqiao Liu", "affiliation": "TAL AI Lab"}, {"author-name": "Wenbiao Ding", "affiliation": "TAL AI Lab"}, {"author-name": "Zhiwei Wang", "affiliation": "Michigan State University"}, {"author-name": "Jiliang Tang", "affiliation": "Michigan State University"}, {"author-name": "Gale Yan Huang", "affiliation": "TAL AI Lab"}, {"author-name": "Zitao Liu", "affiliation": "TAL AI Lab"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 169-173", "keywords": [], "citation": "Liu T., Ding W., Wang Z., Tang J., Huang G.Y., Liu Z.

A method is developed which allows the background knowledge to influence the refinement of queries during the recommendation of learning materials.

However, creating robust dialogue managers for conversational pedagogical agents poses significant challenges. Agents\u2019 misunderstandings and inappropriate responses may cause breakdowns in conversational flow, lead to breaches of trust in agent-student relationships, and negatively impact student learning. Dialogue breakdown detection (DBD) is the task of predicting whether an agent\u2019s utterance will cause a breakdown in an ongoing conversation. A robust DBD framework can support enhanced user experiences by choosing more appropriate responses, while also offering a method to conduct error analyses and improve dialogue managers. This paper presents a multimodal deep learning-based DBD framework to predict breakdowns in student-agent conversations. We investigate this framework with dialogues between middle school students and a conversational pedagogical agent in a game-based learning environment. Results from a study with 92 middle school students demonstrate that multimodal long short-term memory network (LSTM)-based dialogue breakdown detectors incorporating eye gaze features achieve high predictive accuracies and recall rates, suggesting that multimodal detectors can play an important role in designing conversational pedagogical agents that effectively engage students in dialogue."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23207-8_38.json", "data": {"article-title": "Pique: Recommending a Personalized Sequence of Research Papers to Engage Student Curiosity", "author": [{"author-name": "Maryam Mohseni", "affiliation": "UNC Charlotte"}, {"author-name": "Mary Lou Maher", "affiliation": "UNC Charlotte"}, {"author-name": "Kazjon Grace", "affiliation": "University of Sydney"}, {"author-name": "Nadia Najjar", "affiliation": "UNC Charlotte"}, {"author-name": "Fakhri Abbas", "affiliation": "UNC Charlotte"}, {"author-name": "Omar Eltayeby", "affiliation": "UNC Charlotte"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 201-205", "keywords": ["Personalized learning", "Curiosity", "Natural language processing", "Educational recommendation"], "citation": "Mohseni M., Maher M.L., Grace K., Najjar N., Abbas F., Eltayeby O.

Our system generates questions and corresponding answers based on sentences of which 70% make sense.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23207-8_45.json", "data": {"article-title": "Semantic Matching of Open Texts to Pre-scripted Answers in Dialogue-Based Learning", "author": [{"author-name": "S\u0326tefan Rus\u0326et\u0326i", "affiliation": "University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, {"author-name": "Raja Lala", "affiliation": "Utrecht University"}, {"author-name": "Gabriel Gut\u0326u-Robu", "affiliation": "University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, {"author-name": "Mihai Dasca\u0306lu", "affiliation": "University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, {"author-name": "Johan Jeuring", "affiliation": "Utrecht University"}, {"author-name": "Marcell van Geest", "affiliation": "Utrecht University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 242-246", "keywords": ["Answer matching", "Semantic similarity", "Natural Language Processing", "Neural network"], "citation": "Rus\u0326et\u0326i S\u0326., Lala R., Gut\u0326u-Robu G., Dasca\u0306lu M., Jeuring J., van Geest M.

However, most games use pre-scripted dialogues and interactions with players, which limit their immersion and cognition. Our aim is to develop a semantic matching tool that enables users to introduce open text answers which are automatically associated with the most similar pre-scripted answer. A structured scenario written in Dutch was developed by experts for this communication experiment as a sequence of possible interactions within the environment. Semantic similarity scores computed with the SpaCy library were combined with string kernels, WordNet-based distances, and used as features in a neural network. Our experiments show that string kernels are the most predictive feature for determining the most probable pre-scripted answer, whereas neural networks obtain similar performance by combining multiple semantic similarity measures.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23207-8_46.json", "data": {"article-title": "Developing Game-Based Models of Cooperation, Persistence and Problem Solving from Collaborative Gameplay", "author": [{"author-name": "Maria San Pedro"}, {"author-name": "Ruitao Liu"}, {"author-name": "Tamera L.

This paper demonstrates ongoing work of designing and developing game-based models of three CPS components: cooperation, problem-solving, and persistence. A study was conducted collecting data from the game-play of 11 groups (three middle school students in each group) tasked with solving challenges in Physics Playground. We employed evidence-centered design principles to develop behavioral indicators of cooperation, problem-solving and persistence. These were used to code each student\u2019s behavior during three hours of video-recorded gameplay. For each CPS component, we applied hierarchical clustering on this video-coded data and qualitatively evaluated two generated clusters of students across groups. For cooperation, there was more communication with other students in working towards a solution for one group. For problem-solving, one group had more instances of talking about possible solutions. For persistence, one group had more attempts in a challenge and was more on-task. Implications of results, limitations and future work were discussed.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23207-8_47.json", "data": {"article-title": "An Intelligent-Agent Facilitated Scaffold for Fostering Reflection in a Team-Based Project Course", "author": [{"author-name": "Sreecharan Sankaranarayanan", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Xu Wang", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Cameron Dashti", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Marshall An", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Clarence Ngoh", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Michael Hilton", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Majd Sakr", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}, {"author-name": "Carolyn Rose\u0301", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 252-256", "keywords": ["Online Mob Programming", "Project-based learning", "Computer-supported collaborative learning", "Conversational agents"], "citation": "Sankaranarayanan S. et al.

In a study with 67 college students, results showed that the Mixed Initiative policy not only promoted more conversation, but also better supported the goals of the game-based learning environment by fostering exploration, yielding better performance on in-game assessments, and creating higher student engagement."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-23207-8_59.json", "data": {"article-title": "Investigating on Discussion for Sharing Understanding by Using Reciprocal Kit-Build Concept Map", "author": [{"author-name": "Warunya Wunnasri", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}, {"author-name": "Jaruwat Pailai", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}, {"author-name": "Yusuke Hayashi", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}, {"author-name": "Tsukasa Hirashima", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2019", "publication-year": "2019", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 319-323", "keywords": ["Collaborative learning", "Shared understanding", "Pair discussion", "Exploratory talk", "Kit-Build concept map"], "citation": "Wunnasri W., Pailai J., Hayashi Y., Hirashima T.

PS-I activities are designed to facilitate specific cognitive mechanisms that aid learning. This paper seeks to (1) evaluate in what ways PS-I activities compare to inquiry learning, (2) whether students in inquiry learning report similar processes to PS-I, and (3) whether these are associated with better learning. We begin by synthesizing the two approaches in order to highlight their similarities. Following, we coded self-reported post-activity reflections by 139 students who worked with two virtual labs. Students reported processes that are typical to PS-I and, out of these, prior knowledge activation was associated with constructing more complete models.

The training dataset from completed courses with labeled performance will be used to develop a model that can effectively predict the performance well in advance. This can help to prescribe techniques like extra help through more exercises, reference material for whom the predicted performance is below the threshold level.

We employ heatmaps to examine the diversity of student collaborative interactions and Markov transition probabilities to explore the transitions between instances of collaborative interactions. Findings indicate that letting students work on their own promotes the development of technical skills, while working together encourages students to spend more time in the makerspace. This confirms the intuition that successful projects in makerspaces necessitate both individual and group efforts. Furthermore, such aggregation and display of information can aid instructors in uncovering the state of student learning in makerspaces. Identifying the instances and diversity of collaborative interactions affords instructors an early opportunity to identify struggling students and having these data in a near real-time manner opens new doors in terms of making (un)productive behaviors salient, both for teachers and students.

However, there is no study yet that analyse the effect of combining several profiles. In this paper, we study the usage data from 258 students who used a gamified learning environment as a part of their mathematics class. By simulating different adaptation techniques, we show that the learner model chosen to tailor gamification has significant effects on learners\u2019 motivation and engaged behaviours depending on the profile(s) used in this context.

In this paper we explore how adaptivity may be shared across AIEd systems and the various human stakeholders who work with them.

This activity, SoundHunters, targets the development of learner phonological awareness (i.e., their ability to understand and manipulate sounds in a language) through game play. A mixed-methods study was used to measure learning and explore learner experiences. Learner performance on a transcription task, which required the mapping of sounds to characters, improved following SoundHunters use. The nature of learner errors indicates the development of learners\u2019 interlanguage and provides evidence of transfer from English to Cree. Additionally, learners enjoyed the activity while finding it appropriately challenging. These results show the potential for using adaptive technology to support learning in low-resource settings, such as those that exist for most Indigenous languages."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52237-7_29.json", "data": {"article-title": "Moodoo: Indoor Positioning Analytics for Characterising Classroom Teaching", "author": [{"author-name": "Roberto Martinez-Maldonado", "affiliation": "Monash University"}, {"author-name": "Vanessa Echeverria", "affiliation": ["Escuela Superior Polite\u0301cnica del Litoral, ESPOL", "Carnegie Mellon University"]}, {"author-name": "Jurgen Schulte", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney"}, {"author-name": "Antonette Shibani", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney"}, {"author-name": "Katerina Mangaroska", "affiliation": ["Monash University", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU"]}, {"author-name": "Simon Buckingham Shum", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 360-373", "keywords": ["Spatial modelling", "Indoor localisation", "Learning spaces"], "citation": "Martinez-Maldonado R., Echeverria V., Schulte J., Shibani A., Mangaroska K., Buckingham Shum S.

In this paper, we report the observations from two classes of university students using EER-Tutor. In 2018, the system was available for completely voluntary practice. We hypothesized that the students\u2019 pre-existing knowledge and the time spent in EER-Tutor, mediated by the number of attempted EER-Tutor problems, contribute to the students\u2019 scores on the assignment. All but one student used EER-Tutor to draw their assignment solutions, and 77% also used it for tutored problem solving. All our hypotheses were confirmed. Given the found benefits of tutored problem solving, we modified the assignment for the 2019 class so that the first part required students to solve three problems in EER-Tutor (without feedback), while the second part was similar to the 2018 assignment. Our hypothesized model fits the data well and shows the positive relationship between the three set problems on the overall system use, and the assignment scores. In 2019, 98% of the class engaged in tutored problem solving.

However, little evidence has shown that DRL can be successfully applied to real-life human-centric tasks such as education or healthcare. Different from classic game-playing where the RL goal is to make an agent smart, in human-centric tasks the ultimate RL goal is to make the human-agent interactions productive and fruitful. Additionally, in many real-life human-centric tasks, data can be noisy and limited. As a sub-field of RL, batch RL is designed for handling situations where data is limited yet noisy, and building simulations is challenging. In two consecutive classroom studies, we investigated applying batch DRL to the task of pedagogical policy induction for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and empirically evaluated the effectiveness of induced pedagogical policies. In Fall 2018 (F18), the DRL policy is compared against an expert-designed baseline policy and in Spring 2019 (S19), we examined the impact of explaining the batch DRL-induced policy with student decisions and the expert baseline policy. Our results showed that 1) while no significant difference was found between the batch RL-induced policy and the expert policy in F18, the batch RL-induced policy with simple explanations significantly improved students\u2019 learning performance more than the expert policy alone in S19; and 2) no significant differences were found between the student decision making and the expert policy.

However, previous research shows that many students tend to avoid feedback regarding failures, including critical constructive feedback (CCF) that is intended to support and guide them. This is especially true for lower-achieving students, who might perceive feedback as an ego-threat, and therefore protect themselves by neglecting it. However, it has been shown that such neglect can be suppressed by using teachable agents (TA\u2019s). Another, but less studied factor that influences feedback acceptance is the degree or extent of failure when trying to solve a task. The present study explores if and how momentary performance levels influence middle school students\u2019 willingness to accept CCF when playing an educational game in history \u2013 with or without a TA. On the basis of teacher assessments of the students\u2019 general skills, data logs and analyses of sequential patterns, we concluded that the willingness to accept CCF differs between students, but also between conditions and situations. One major finding is that a TA supports the students to more readily embrace CCF, even if the effect is larger for lower-achieving students. Another finding is that indications of being far from succeeding, such as low success rates or repeated trials and revisions, have a negative impact on feedback acceptance, even if a TA mitigates some of this influence. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to meta-cognitive aspects of learning and to educational software design."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52237-7_44.json", "data": {"article-title": "Robust Neural Automated Essay Scoring Using Item Response Theory", "author": [{"author-name": "Masaki Uto", "affiliation": "The University of Electro-Communications"}, {"author-name": "Masashi Okano", "affiliation": "The University of Electro-Communications"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 549-561", "keywords": ["Deep neural networks", "Item response theory", "Automated essay scoring", "Rater bias"], "citation": "Uto M., Okano M.

DNN-AES models require training on a large dataset of graded essays. However, assigned grades in such datasets are known to be strongly biased due to effects of rater bias when grading is conducted by assigning a few raters in a rater set to each essay. Performance of DNN models rapidly drops when such biased data are used for model training. In the fields of educational and psychological measurement, item response theory (IRT) models that can estimate essay scores while considering effects of rater characteristics have recently been proposed. This study therefore proposes a new DNN-AES framework that integrates IRT models to deal with rater bias within training data.

In this work, we seek to explore the development of tools to automatically assess audio responses within a college-level Chinese language-learning course. We build a model designed to grade student audio assignments with the purpose of incorporating such a model into tools focused on helping both teachers and students in real classrooms. Building upon our prior work which explored features extracted from audio, the goal of this work is to explore additional features derived from tone and speech recognition models to help assess students on two outcomes commonly observed in language learning classes: fluency and accuracy of speech. In addition to the exploration of features, this work explores the application of Siamese deep learning models for this assessment task. We find that models utilizing tonal features exhibit higher predictive performance of student fluency while text-based features derived from speech recognition models exhibit higher predictive performance of student accuracy of speech."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52237-7_46.json", "data": {"article-title": "Early Detection of Wheel-Spinning in ASSISTments", "author": [{"author-name": "Yeyu Wang", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}, {"author-name": "Shimin Kai", "affiliation": "Columbia University"}, {"author-name": "Ryan Shaun Baker", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 574-585", "keywords": ["Wheel-spinning", "Persistence", "Decision tree", "Early detection", "Intelligent tutoring system"], "citation": "Wang Y., Kai S., Baker R.S.

To understand how quickly we can detect each state, we use data from different numbers of practice opportunities and compare model performance across student-problem set pairs. We identify that a model constructed using data from the first nine practice opportunities outperforms models using less practice data. However, it is possible to differentiate students who will eventually wheel-spin from learners who will persist productively using data from only the first three opportunities. Wheel-spinning can be differentiated from non-persistence from the first five opportunities, and non-persistence can be differentiated from productive persistence from the first seven opportunities. These results show that early differentiation between wheel-spinning and productive persistence is feasible. These detectors relied upon hint requests, the correctness of prior opportunities, and the amount of practice and time on the skill.

We explore the use of automated question answering methods to power virtual TAs in online course discussion forums, which are heavily relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic as classes transition online. First, we focus on answering frequent and repetitive logistical questions and adopt a question answering framework that consists of two steps: retrieving relevant documents from a repository and extracting answers from retrieved documents. The document repository consists of course materials that contain information on course logistics, e.g., the syllabus, lecture slides, course emails, and prior discussion forum posts. This question answering framework can help virtual TAs decide whether a question is answerable and how to answer it. Second, we analyze the timing of student posts in discussion threads and develop a classifier to predict the timing of follow-up posts.

Collaborative game-based learning environments that can detect this off-task behavior in real-time have the potential to enhance collaboration between students by redirecting the conversation back to more productive topics. This paper investigates the use of dialogue analysis to classify student conversational utterances as either off-task or on-task. Using classroom data collected from 13 groups of four students, we trained off-task dialogue models for text messages from a group chat feature integrated into Crystal Island: EcoJourneys, a collaborative game-based learning environment for middle school ecosystem science. We evaluate the effectiveness of the off-task dialogue models, which use different word embeddings (i.e., word2vec, ELMo, and BERT), as well as predictive off-task dialogue models that capture varying amounts of contextual information from the chat log. Results indicate that predictive off-task dialogue models that incorporate a window of recent context and represent the sequential nature of the chat messages achieve higher predictive performance compared to models that do not leverage this information.

Reflective thinking serves a critical role in inquiry-based learning by encouraging students to think critically about their knowledge and experiences in order to foster deeper learning processes. Free-response reflection prompts can be embedded in game-based learning environments to encourage students to engage in reflection and externalize their reflection processes, but automatically assessing student reflection presents significant challenges. In this paper, we present a framework for automatically assessing students\u2019 written reflection responses during inquiry-based learning in Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology. Using data from a classroom study involving 153 middle school students, we compare the effectiveness of several computational representations of students\u2019 natural language responses to reflection prompts\u2014GloVe, ELMo, tf-idf, unigrams\u2014across several machine learning-based regression techniques (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron) to assess the depth of student reflection responses. Results demonstrate that assessment models based on ELMo deep contextualized word representations yield more accurate predictions of students\u2019 written reflection depth than competing techniques. These findings point toward the potential of leveraging automated assessment of student reflection to inform real-time adaptive support for inquiry-based learning in game-based learning environments."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52237-7_7.json", "data": {"article-title": "Can Ontologies Support the Gamification of Scripted Collaborative Learning Sessions?", "author": [{"author-name": "Geiser Chalco Challco", "affiliation": ["University of Sa\u0303o Paulo", "Federal University of Alagoas"]}, {"author-name": "Ig Ibert Bittencourt", "affiliation": "Federal University of Alagoas"}, {"author-name": "Seiji Isotani", "affiliation": "University of Sa\u0303o Paulo"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 79-91", "keywords": ["Gamification", "Ontologies", "Scripted collaboration"], "citation": "Challco G.C., Bittencourt I.I., Isotani S.

Although several datasets, such as ASSISTments, Junyi Academy, Synthetic and STATICS are publicly available and widely used, they are not large enough to leverage the full potential of state-of-the-art data-driven models. Furthermore, the recorded behavior is limited to question-solving activities. To this end, we introduce EdNet, a large-scale hierarchical dataset of diverse student activities collected by Santa, a multi-platform self-study solution equipped with an artificial intelligence tutoring system. EdNet contains 131,417,236 interactions from 784,309 students collected over more than 2 years, making it the largest public IES dataset released to date. Unlike existing datasets, EdNet records a wide variety of student actions ranging from question-solving to lecture consumption to item purchasing. Also, EdNet has a hierarchical structure which divides the student actions into 4 different levels of abstractions. The features of EdNet are domain-agnostic, allowing EdNet to be easily extended to different domains. The dataset is publicly released for research purposes.

Many educators are hesitant to give authority to an automated system, especially in assessment tasks such as grading constructed response items. However, evaluating free-response text can be time and labor costly for one rater, let alone multiple raters. In addition, some degree of inconsistency exists within and between raters for assessing a given task. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing have resulted in subsequent improvements for technologies that rely on artificial intelligence and human language. New, state-of-the-art models such as BERT, an open source, pre-trained language model, have decreased the amount of training data needed for specific tasks and in turn, have reduced the amount of human annotation necessary for producing a high-quality classification model. After training BERT on expert ratings of constructed responses, we use subsequent automated grading to calculate Cohen\u2019s Kappa as a measure of inter-rater reliability between the automated system and the human rater. For practical application, when the inter-rater reliability metric is unsatisfactory, we suggest that the human rater(s) use the automated model to call attention to ratings where a second opinion might be needed to confirm the rater\u2019s correctness and consistency of judgement.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52240-7_15.json", "data": {"article-title": "Multi-document Cohesion Network Analysis: Visualizing Intratextual and Intertextual Links", "author": [{"author-name": "Maria-Dorinela Dascalu", "affiliation": "University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, {"author-name": "Stefan Ruseti", "affiliation": "University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, {"author-name": "Mihai Dascalu", "affiliation": ["University Politehnica of Bucharest", "Academy of Romanian Scientists"]}, {"author-name": "Danielle McNamara", "affiliation": "Arizona State University"}, {"author-name": "S\u0327tefan Trausan-Matu", "affiliation": ["University Politehnica of Bucharest", "Academy of Romanian Scientists"]}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 80-85", "keywords": ["Cohesion Network Analysis", "Semantic links", "Lexical overlap links", "Coreference links", "Graph visualizations"], "citation": "Dascalu MD., Ruseti S., Dascalu M., McNamara D.S., Trausan-Matu S.

In fact, during the Coronovirus pandemic, online curation of resources provides teachers a repository of materials to provide students in online space. Teachers\u2019 engagement online then provides the ability to learn more about how teachers are addressing students\u2019 learning needs and potentially improve the quality of the resources they share. Historically, to perform such a study, we often survey some teachers and then leverage their shared resources to investigate education-related research questions. However, this can lead to problems including sample representativeness where surveyed teachers may not be representative of the population of teachers in social media. In this paper, we attempt to improve the sample representativeness of teachers on Pinterest. We first survey 541 teachers in the United States as seed samples and then collect their online data and social connections on Pinterest. Then, we devise a heuristic that automatically identifies other Pinterest accounts that are likely to be teachers thus improving the sample representativeness. Finally, we evaluate our heuristic with advanced machine learning techniques.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52240-7_25.json", "data": {"article-title": "A Framework for Exploring the Impact of Tutor Practices on Learner Self-regulation in Online Environments", "author": [{"author-name": "Madiha Khan-Galaria", "affiliation": "University College London"}, {"author-name": "Mutlu Cukurova", "affiliation": "University College London"}, {"author-name": "Rosemary Luckin", "affiliation": "University College London"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 135-139", "keywords": ["Self-Regulated learning", "Online tutoring", "Winne and Hadwin model", "Tutor practices", "Metacognition", "Virtual classroom environment", "Process mining"], "citation": "Khan-Galaria M., Cukurova M., Luckin R.

However, CAD is very challenging because (1) classroom conversations contain many conversational turn-taking overlaps between teachers and students; (2) the CAD model needs to be generalized well enough for different teachers and students; and (3) classroom recordings may be very noisy and low-quality. In this work, we address the above challenges by building a Siamese neural framework to automatically identify teacher and student utterances from classroom recordings. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world educational datasets. The results demonstrate that (1) our approach is superior on the prediction tasks for both online and offline classroom environments; and (2) our framework exhibits robustness and generalization ability on new teachers (i.e., teachers never appear in training data)."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52240-7_31.json", "data": {"article-title": "Deep-Cross-Attention Recommendation Model for Knowledge Sharing Micro Learning Service", "author": [{"author-name": "Jiayin Lin", "affiliation": "University of Wollongong"}, {"author-name": "Geng Sun", "affiliation": "University of Wollongong"}, {"author-name": "Jun Shen", "affiliation": ["University of Wollongong", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]}, {"author-name": "David Pritchard", "affiliation": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, {"author-name": "Tingru Cui", "affiliation": "University of Melbourne"}, {"author-name": "Dongming Xu", "affiliation": "The University of Queensland"}, {"author-name": "Li Li", "affiliation": "Southwest University"}, {"author-name": "Ghassan Beydoun", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney"}, {"author-name": "Shiping Chen", "affiliation": "Data 61, CSIRO"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 168-173", "keywords": ["Recommender system", "Neural network", "Micro learning", "Machine learning", "Information retrieval"], "citation": "Lin J. et al.

We thus propose to adopt the post-hoc method to tackle the interpretability issue for deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models. Specifically, we focus on applying the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to interpret RNN-based DLKT model by backpropagating the relevance from the model\u2019s output layer to its input layer. The experiment results show the feasibility using the LRP method for interpreting the DLKT model\u2019s predictions, and partially validate the computed relevance scores.

In the erroneous examples (ErrEx) version of the game, students saw a character play the games and make mistakes, and then they corrected the characters\u2019 errors. In the problem solving (PS) version, students played the games by themselves.

Posthoc (Tukey) tests indicated that students who did not see any erroneous examples (PS-only) experienced significantly lower levels of confrustion (p < .001) and gaming (p < .001).

Being able to automatically parse such input is essential for the practice of interpersonal skills such as empathy. Currently, it is still an open question which prosodic or visual features would aid automatic classification of empathy and how this knowledge can be used to support the practice of these skills. As a first step towards this goal, we report on 42 second-year nursing students practicing their empathy skills with a virtual patient or through collaborative role playing. We found that across both the role playing and simulation, students assessed their empathy as increasing over time but as higher during the role playing.

However, many game-based learning environments do not adaptively support individual students based on their specific knowledge and skills. Often, this is because creating game levels is highly labor-intensive, which limits the number of levels created to support student learning. Procedural content generation (PCG) is a promising direction for addressing this challenge by dynamically creating game levels that address specific student needs without requiring extensive development effort. In this paper, we investigate a PCG framework driven by answer set programming (ASP), a variant of logic programming that utilizes well-formed logical rules to express constraints for valid game levels. We demonstrate how variations in CS learning objectives and game-playing skills can be incorporated into ASP-based rules to generate learner-adaptive levels in a middle-grades CS game-based learning environment. Evaluations of the generated levels suggest that the ASP-based level generator not only reliably generates desired CS educational game levels but also synthesizes a large set of diverse game levels. The findings suggest that the ASP-based PCG approach has considerable promise for creating highly engaging and adaptive game-based learning experiences for K-12 CS education."}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52240-7_45.json", "data": {"article-title": "An Evaluation of Data-Driven Programming Hints in a Classroom Setting", "author": [{"author-name": "Thomas W.

Thirty one students of computer science took part in the experiment. They analyzed two program codes written in the C++ language to search for (1) logical errors (LER) and (2) syntax errors (SER). ICL was measured by subjective rating of the difficulty of each task. There were significant differences found for the subjective measures of intrinsic load, the effectiveness and the time of tasks performance, and the values of eye tracking parameters: fixation duration average (FDA) and saccade amplitude average (SAA) in two experiment conditions. Longer fixation and shorter saccades were associated with higher ICL.

In recent years, many existing works have been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task, particularly recurrent neural networks based methods, e.g., Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). However, DKT has the problem of vibration in prediction outputs. In this paper, to better understand the problem of DKT, we utilize a mathematical computation model named Finite State Automaton(FSA), which can change from one state to another in response to the external input, to interpret the hidden state transition of the DKT when receiving inputs. And we discover the root cause of the two problems is that the DKT can not handle the long sequence input with the help of FSA. Accordingly, we propose an effective attention-based model, which can solve the above problem by directly capturing the relationships among each item of the input regardless of the length of the input sequence. The experimental results show that our proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on several well-known corpora.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-030-52240-7_67.json", "data": {"article-title": "Identifying Beneficial Learning Behaviors from Large-Scale Interaction Data", "author": [{"author-name": "Miruna Cristus", "affiliation": "Sana Labs"}, {"author-name": "Oscar Ta\u0308ckstro\u0308m", "affiliation": "Sana Labs"}, {"author-name": "Lingyi Tan", "affiliation": "Sana Labs"}, {"author-name": "Valentino Pacifici", "affiliation": "Sana Labs"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2020", "publication-year": "2020", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 371-375", "keywords": ["Learning behavior", "Test preparation", "Educational data mining"], "citation": "Cristus M., Ta\u0308ckstro\u0308m O., Tan L., Pacifici V.

However, to date, most studies tend to focus on utilizing these measures to explore metacognitive skills (MS) rather than ME. Also, while some studies do explore ME with these measures tend to utilize the data from a summative perspective rather than aligning the data with the real-time ME behaviours. Based on previous works in this field, this research will discuss how feeling of difficulty (i.e. a type of ME) functions in real-time based on the hypothesis that eye-tracking and SCR data can provide objective measures.

As a first step in addressing this problem, we present a cognitive task analysis study that investigates how students without a mathematics-related background solve novel non-routine problems. We found that most students were able to identify the underlying pattern that yields the final solution in each problem.

Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_12", "abstract": "A major limitation of the current generation of MOOCs is a lack of opportunity for students to make use of each other as resources. Analyses of attrition and learning in MOOCs both point to the importance of social engagement for motivational support and overcoming difficulties with material and course procedures. In this paper we evaluate an intervention that makes synchronous collaboration opportunities available to students in an edX MOOC. We have implemented a Lobby program that students can access via a live link at any time. Upon entering the Lobby, they are matched with other students that are logged in to it. Once matched, they are provided with a link to a chat room where they can work with their partner students on a synchronous collaboration activity, supported by a conversational computer agent. Results of a survival model in which we control for level of effort suggest that having experienced a collaborative chat is associated with a slow down in the rate of attrition over time by a factor of two. We discuss implications for design, limitations of the current study, and directions for future research."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-19773-9_120.json", "data": {"article-title": "Selection Task and Computer-Based Feedback to Improve the Searching Process in Task-Oriented Reading Situations", "author": [{"author-name": "Mari\u0301a-A\u0301ngeles Serrano", "affiliation": "Universitat de Valencia"}, {"author-name": "Eduardo Vidal-Abarca", "affiliation": "Universitat de Valencia"}, {"author-name": "Ignacio Ma\u0301n\u0303ez", "affiliation": "Universitat de Valencia"}, {"author-name": "Carmen Candel", "affiliation": "Universitat de Valencia"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2015", "publication-year": "2015", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 804-807", "keywords": ["Self-regulation strategies", "Selecting text information", "Automatic feedback", "Task-oriented reading"], "citation": "Serrano MA\u0301., Vidal-Abarca E., Ma\u0301n\u0303ez I., Candel C.

An ANOVA was used to assess if participants who were highly confident in their wrong diagnosis engaged in more faulty data gathering via confirmation bias.

The current work uses a user-centered design approach to extend an ITS for equation solving, Lynnette, so the new designs may motivate and help students learn to apply a general, transferable rule for effective problem selection, namely, to select problem types that are not fully mastered (\u201cMastery Rule\u201d). We conducted user research through classroom experimentation, interviews and storyboards. We found that the presence of an Open Learner Model significantly improves students\u2019 problem selection decisions, which has not been empirically established by prior work; also, lack of motivation, especially lack of a mastery-approach orientation, may cause difficulty in applying the Mastery Rule. Based on our user research, we designed prototypes of tutor features that aim to foster a mastery-approach orientation as well as transfer of the learned Mastery Rule when the scaffolding is faded. The work contributes to the research of supporting SRL in ITSs through a motivational design perspective, and lays foundation for future controlled experiments to evaluate the transfer of the problem selection skill in new tutor units where there is no scaffolding."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-19773-9_24.json", "data": {"article-title": "SNS Messages Recommendation for Learning Motivation", "author": [{"author-name": "Se\u0301bastien Louvigne\u0301", "affiliation": "University of Electro-Communications"}, {"author-name": "Yoshihiro Kato", "affiliation": "University of Electro-Communications"}, {"author-name": "Neil Rubens", "affiliation": "University of Electro-Communications"}, {"author-name": "Maomi Ueno", "affiliation": "University of Electro-Communications"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2015", "publication-year": "2015", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 237-246", "keywords": ["Learning motivation", "Social networks", "Recommendation", "Latent dirichlet allocation"], "citation": "Louvigne\u0301 S., Kato Y., Rubens N., Ueno M.

We find that practicing equation solving in either interface was associated with improved scores on a multiple choice assessment, but that users who had the freedom to make mistakes were more satisfied with the interface. In order to make inferences from these more freeform data, we develop a Bayesian inverse planning algorithm for diagnosing algebra understanding that interprets individual equation solving steps and places no restrictions on the ordering or correctness of steps. This algorithms draws inferences and exhibits similar confidence based on data from either interface.

For instructional planning to work in DOELEs, an approach is needed that does not rely on data structures such as prerequisite graphs that would need to be continually rewired as the LOs change. A promising approach is collaborative filtering based on learning sequences (CFLS) using the ecological approach (EA) architecture. We developed a CFLS planner that compares a given learner\u2019s most recent path of LOs (of length \\(b\\)) to other learners to create a neighbourhood of similar learners. The future paths (of length \\(f\\)) of these neighbours are checked and the most successful path ahead is recommended to the target learner, who then follows that path for a certain length (called \\(s\\)). An experiment with simulated learners was used to explore what are the best values of \\(b\\), \\(f\\) and \\(s\\). Results showed that the CFLS planner should avoid sending a learner any further ahead (\\(s\\)) than they have been matched in the past (\\(b\\)), a prediction that can be applied to the real world."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-19773-9_67.json", "data": {"article-title": "Modeling Self-Efficacy Across Age Groups with Automatically Tracked Facial Expression", "author": [{"author-name": "Joseph F.

In a pilot study with an early version of Engage, a game-based learning environment for middle school computer science education, female students reported higher initial frustration. To address this critical issue, we developed a prototype learning companion designed specifically to reduce frustration through the telling of autobiographical stories. In a pilot study of two 7th grade classrooms, female students responded especially positively to the learning companion, eliminating the gender gap in reported frustration.

However, the construction of uniforms tests often suffers bias of item exposure frequency. Ideally, the item exposure frequency should have a uniform and low distribution. For this purpose, we propose a clique algorithm for uniform test forms assembly with low item exposure. We formalize this test assembly as a searching the clique that has minimum item exposure in the maximum cliques. As the results, the proposed method utilizes the item pool more efficiently than traditional methods do. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulated and actual data."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-19773-9_81.json", "data": {"article-title": "Game Features and Individual Differences: Interactive Effects on Motivation and Performance", "author": [{"author-name": "Matthew E.

This allows SIAL to accept several solutions to the proposed exercise, all of which are correct, providing a kind of open-ended feature to the ITS. The Domain Model is in charge of carrying out the error diagnosis, identifying, in many cases, the misunderstandings. The focus of this paper is to describe the Pedagogical Model of SIAL that takes advantage of the error diagnosis capabilities of the Domain Model to offer a learner-adaptive tutorial action, according to the user cognitive profile."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-19773-9_97.json", "data": {"article-title": "Predictive Knowledge Modeling in Collaborative Inquiry Learning Scenarios", "author": [{"author-name": "Sven Manske", "affiliation": "University Duisburg-Essen"}, {"author-name": "Tobias Hecking", "affiliation": "University Duisburg-Essen"}, {"author-name": "H.

Such professionals are essentially engaged in lifelong learning, and the platform that helps them interact with each other essentially supports a community of professional learners. In our research we have been studying one such community, the community of programmers supported by Stack Overflow (SO), with the ultimate goal of diagnosing the knowledge needs of the SO users in such an open ended and evolving learning environment. In this paper, we report on a study that is a step in the direction of achieving this goal. In particular we diagnosed the knowledge of users in SO to see if their performance level in answering questions could be predicted from their previous behavior. We used a tag-based knowledge model and a Naive Bayes model in making predictions. We measured the success of our predictions using 10-fold cross validation, root mean square deviation, and mean absolute error. Over different sample sizes and different numbers of tags, we achieved prediction accuracy ranging between 84.644% and 91.709%, root mean square error ranging between 0.0517 and .0629, and mean absolute error ranging between 0.011 and .0115. This level of success suggests the potential to provide adaptive feedback about an individual\u2019s knowledge needs even before poor answers are provided. The approach has the further advantages of being lightweight (requiring minimal knowledge engineering) and of having the potential to evolve naturally with changes in the learner\u2019s knowledge and changes in the disciplinary knowledge."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-61425-0_11.json", "data": {"article-title": "iSTART-ALL: Confronting Adult Low Literacy with Intelligent Tutoring for Reading Comprehension", "author": [{"author-name": "Amy M.

Based on the studies, we identify whether learning is happening and what kind of interaction contributes to learning, what difficulties participants face and how these can be overcome with additional intelligent support. Our findings show that participants who engaged in constructive learning have improved their conceptual understanding of presentation skills, while those who exhibited more passive ways of learning have not improved as much as constructive learners. Analysis of participants\u2019 profiles and experiences led to requirements for intelligent support with active video watching. Based on this, we propose intelligent nudging in the form of signposting and prompts to further promote constructive learning.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-319-61425-0_2.json", "data": {"article-title": "Evaluating the Effect of Uncertainty Visualisation in Open Learner Models on Students\u2019 Metacognitive Skills", "author": [{"author-name": "Lamiya Al-Shanfari", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham"}, {"author-name": "Carrie Demmans Epp", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh"}, {"author-name": "Chris Baber", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2017", "publication-year": "2017", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 15-27", "keywords": ["Open learner models", "Uncertainty", "Self-confidence", "Visualisation", "Metacognitive skills", "Learning dashboards"], "citation": "Al-Shanfari L., Demmans Epp C., Baber C.

We propose a two-phased approach for automatic engagement detection: In Phase 1, contextual logs are utilized to assess active usage of the content platform. If there is active use, the appearance information is utilized in Phase 2 to infer behavioral engagement. Through authentic classroom pilots, we collected around 170 hours of in-the-wild data from 28 students in two different classrooms using two different content platforms (one for Math and one for English as a Second Language (ESL)). Our data collection application captured appearance data from a 3D camera and context data from uniform resource locator (URL) logs. We experimented with two test cases: (1) Cross-classroom, where trained models were tested on a different classroom\u2019s data; (2) Cross-platform, where the data collected in different subject areas (Math or ESL) were utilized in training and testing, respectively. For the first case, the behavioral engagement was detected with an F1-score of 77%, using only appearance. Incorporating the contextual information improved the overall performance to 82%. For the second case, even though the subject areas and content platforms changed, the proposed appearance classifier still achieved 72% accuracy (compared to 77%). Our experiments proved that the accuracy of the proposed model is not adversely impacted considering different set of students or different subject areas.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-319-61425-0_22.json", "data": {"article-title": "Improving Reading Comprehension with Automatically Generated Cloze Item Practice", "author": [{"author-name": "Andrew Olney", "affiliation": "University of Memphis"}, {"author-name": "Philip I.

Recent years have seen growing interest in data-driven techniques for tutorial planning, which dynamically personalize learning experiences by providing hints, feedback, and problem scenarios at run-time. In game-based learning environments, tutorial planners are designed to adapt gameplay events in order to achieve multiple objectives, such as enhancing student learning or student engagement, which may be complementary or competing aims. In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for inducing game-based tutorial planners that balance between improving learning and engagement in game-based learning environments. We investigate a model-based, linear-scalarized multi-policy algorithm, Convex Hull Value Iteration, to induce a tutorial planner from a corpus of student interactions with a game-based learning environment for middle school science education. Results indicate that multi-objective reinforcement learning creates policies that are more effective at balancing multiple reward sources than single-objective techniques. A qualitative analysis of select policies and multi-objective preference vectors shows how a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework shapes the selection of tutorial actions during students\u2019 game-based learning experiences to effectively achieve targeted learning and engagement outcomes.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-319-61425-0_28.json", "data": {"article-title": "Is More Agency Better?

It is now known that one can\u2019t support a student in a learning task without being aware of his level of skills (what he/she knows and what he/she needs to know). Thus, it is important in the setting up of the learner model to consider an efficient mechanism that can both assess and predict her skills. This paper describes the Bayesian Network (that allows real time diagnosis, prediction and modeling of the learner\u2019s state of skills) implemented in the learner component of Logic-Muse. We proved that the BN (Bayesian Network) is able to predict with an accuracy near 85%, the answers of learners on different exercises of the domain.

However, in this case, a difficulty remains that the assessment accuracies of learners in each group depends on the assigned rater. To solve that problem, this study proposes a group optimization method to maximize peer assessment accuracy based on item response theory using integer programming. Experimental results, however, showed that the proposed method does not necessarily present higher accuracy than a random group formation. Therefore, we further propose an external rater selection method that assigns a few outside-group raters to each learner.

We compared the adaptive strategy to the fixed WPEP strategy, and found that students in the adaptive condition significantly improved their post-test scores on conceptual, procedural and debugging questions."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-61425-0_45.json", "data": {"article-title": "Constraint-Based Modelling as a Tutoring Framework for Japanese Honorifics", "author": [{"author-name": "Zachary T.

This paper reports a practical use of Error-based Simulation (EBS) for correcting students\u2019 MIF misconceptions in a junior high school and a technical college. EBS is a method to generate a phenomenon by using students\u2019 erroneous idea (e.g., if a student thinks forward force applied to a skater traveling straight on ice at a constant velocity, EBS shows the skater accelerates). Such a phenomenon is supposed to work as a counterexample to students\u2019 misconception. In the practice, students first worked on pre-test of five problems (called \u2018learning task\u2019), in each of which they drew all the forces applied to objects in a mechanical situation. They then worked on the same problems on system where EBSs were shown based on their answer. They last worked on post-test of the previous plus four new problems (called \u2018transfer task\u2019). As a result, in both schools, the numbers of MIF-answers (the erroneous answers supposed due to MIF misconception) in learning task decreased significantly between pre-test and post-test. Effect sizes of the decrease of MIF-answers were larger than that of other erroneous answers. Additionally, the percentages of MIF-answers to the whole erroneous answers in transfer task were much lower than those in learning task. These results suggest learning with EBS not only has the effect on the resolution of MIF misconception, but also promoted the correction of errors in conceptual level."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-61425-0_80.json", "data": {"article-title": "Interaction Analysis in Online Maths Human Tutoring: The Case of Third Space Learning", "author": [{"author-name": "Mutlu Cukurova", "affiliation": "University College London"}, {"author-name": "Manolis Mavrikis", "affiliation": "University College London"}, {"author-name": "Rosemary Luckin", "affiliation": "University College London"}, {"author-name": "James Clark", "affiliation": "Third Space Learning"}, {"author-name": "Candida Crawford", "affiliation": "Third Space Learning"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2017", "publication-year": "2017", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 636-643", "keywords": ["Online tutoring", "Annotation software", "Best practice modeling"], "citation": "Cukurova M., Mavrikis M., Luckin R., Clark J., Crawford C.

It is being used as a medium to encourage certain student behaviors in anticipation of positive effects on learning experience and achievement. However, existing studies have mostly implemented reward-based game elements which have resulted to contrasting behaviors among students. Meaningful gamification, defined as the use of game design elements to encourage users build internal motivation to behave in a certain way, is contended to be a more effective approach. This concept is founded on the \u2018Self-Determination Theory\u2019, which states that there are three components associated with intrinsic motivation: mastery, autonomy, and relatedness.

One way in which the tutor can fade support is to prompt or elicit a next step that requires the student to fill in some intermediate actions or reasoning on her own. But what should the tutor do if the student is unable to complete such a step? In human-human tutoring interactions, a tutor may remediate by explicitly covering the missing intermediate steps with the student and in some contexts this behavior correlates with learning. But if there are multiple intermediate steps that need to be made explicit, the tutor could focus the student\u2019s attention on the last successful step and then move forward through the intermediate steps (forward reasoning) or the tutor could focus the student\u2019s attention on the intermediate step just before the failed step and move backward through the intermediate steps (backward reasoning). In this paper we explore when the forward strategy or backward strategy may be beneficial for remediation. We also compare the two faded support+remediation strategies to a control in which support is never faded and found that faded support was not detrimental to student learning outcomes when the two remediation strategies were available and it took significantly less time on task to achieve similar learning gains when starting the tutor-student interaction with faded support."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-93843-1_17.json", "data": {"article-title": "Validating Revised Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy Using Deep Knowledge Tracing", "author": [{"author-name": "Amar Lalwani", "affiliation": "funtoot"}, {"author-name": "Sweety Agrawal", "affiliation": "funtoot"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2018", "publication-year": "2018", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 225-238", "keywords": ["Deep knowledge tracing", "Revised Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy", "Cognitive skills", "Hierarchical taxonomy", "Deep learning", "Student modeling", "Domain knowledge", "funtoot"], "citation": "Lalwani A., Agrawal S.

To do this, we focus on the phenomenon of entrainment, where individuals adapt their paraverbal features of speech to one another.

In a study with 72 middle school students, we evaluate the effects of entrainment with a teachable robot, a pedagogical agent that learners teach how to solve ratio problems. We explore how a teachable robot which entrains and introduces social dialogue influences rapport and learning; we compare with two baseline conditions: a social condition, in which the robot speaks socially, and a non-social condition, in which the robot neither entrains nor speaks socially.

Students in the learning by teaching (LBT) condition used an online learning environment (APLUS), where they interactively taught a teachable agent (SimStudent) how to solve equations with a goal to have the teachable agent pass the quiz. Students in the learning by being tutored condition used a version of cognitive tutor that uses the same user interface as APLUS, but no teachable agent. Instead, a teacher agent tutored students how to solve equations. The goal for students in this condition was to pass the quiz by themselves. Students selected and entered problems to be tutored by themselves. This condition is hence called Goal-Oriented Practice (GOP). For both conditions, students received metacognitive scaffolding on how to teach the teachable agent (LBT) and how to regulate their learning (GOP). The results from the classroom studies show that (1) students in both conditions learned equally well, measured as pre- and post-test scores, (2) prior competency does not influence the effect of LBT nor GOP (i.e., no aptitude-treatment interaction observed), and (3) GOP students primarily focused on submitting the quiz rather than practicing on problems.

Agency is assumed to lead to engagement and fun, but may or may not be helpful to learning. While the best learners are often good self-regulated learners, many students are not, only benefiting from instructional choices made for them. In the study presented in this paper, involving a total of 158 fifth and sixth grade students, children played a mathematics learning game called Decimal Point, which helps middle-school students learn decimals. One group of students (79) played and learned with a low-agency version of the game, in which they were guided to play all \u201cmini-games\u201d in a prescribed sequence. The other group of students (79) played and learned with a high-agency version of the game, in which they could choose how many and in what order they would play the mini-games. The results show there were no significant differences in learning or enjoyment across the low and high-agency conditions. A key reason for this may be that students across conditions did not substantially vary in the way they played, perhaps due to the indirect control features present in the game. It may also be the case that the young students who participated in this study did not exercise their agency or self-regulated learning. This work is relevant to the AIED community, as it explores how game-based learning can be adapted. In general, once we know which game and learning features lead to the best learning outcomes, as well as the circumstances that maximize those outcomes, we can better design AI-powered, adaptive games for learning."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-93843-1_26.json", "data": {"article-title": "Engaging with the Scenario: Affect and Facial Patterns from a Scenario-Based Intelligent Tutoring System", "author": [{"author-name": "Benjamin Nye", "affiliation": "University of Southern California"}, {"author-name": "Shamya Karumbaiah", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania"}, {"author-name": "S.

In this study, we investigate the following research questions: For affective state labeling, how does the socio-cultural background of human expert labelers, compared to the subjects (i.e., students), impact the degree of consensus and distribution of affective states obtained? Secondly, how do differences in labeler background impact the performance of affect detection models that are trained using these labels? To address these questions, we employed experts from Turkey and the United States to label the same data collected through authentic classroom pilots with students in Turkey. We analyzed within-country and cross-country inter-rater agreements, finding that experts from Turkey obtained moderately better inter-rater agreement than the experts from the U.S., and the two groups did not agree with each other. In addition, we observed differences between the distributions of affective states provided by experts in the U.S. versus Turkey, and between the performances of the resulting affect detectors.

ASSISTments, an online mathematics platform, is hosting a series of randomized controlled trials targeting these needs to promote integrated learning.

A mastery criterion decides whether a learner should continue practice of a current topic or move to a more advanced topic.

In this paper, we propose Cognitive Representation Learner (CogRL), a novel framework to learn accurate cognitive models in ill-structured domains with no data and little to no human knowledge engineering. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we show that representations learnt using CogRL can be used for accurate automatic cognitive model discovery without using any student performance data in several ill-structured domains: Rumble Blocks, Chinese Character, and Article Selection. This is especially effective and useful in domains where an accurate human-authored cognitive model is unavailable or authoring a cognitive model is difficult. Secondly, for domains where a cognitive model is available, we show that representations learned through CogRL can be used to get accurate estimates of skill difficulty and learning rate parameters without using any student performance data.

Surgical training has traditionally relied upon experienced surgeons mentoring trainees through cadaveric dissection and operating theatre practice. However, with the growing demand for more surgeons and more efficient training programs, it has become necessary to employ supplementary forms of training such as virtual reality simulation. However, the use of such simulations as autonomous training platforms is limited by the extent to which they can provide automated performance feedback. Recent work has focused on overcoming this issue by developing algorithms to provide feedback that emulates the advice of human experts. These algorithms can mainly be categorized into rule-based and machine learning based methods, and they have typically been validated through user studies against controls that received no feedback. To our knowledge, no investigations into the performance of the two types of feedback generation methods in comparison to each other have so far been conducted. To this end, we introduce a rule-based method of providing technical feedback in virtual reality simulation-based temporal bone surgery, implement a machine learning based method that has been proven to outperform other similar methods, and compare their performance in teaching surgical skills in practice through a user study. We show that simpler rule-based methods can be equally or more effective in teaching surgical skills when compared to more complex methods of feedback generation."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-93843-1_44.json", "data": {"article-title": "Reciprocal Kit-Building of Concept Map to Share Each Other\u2019s Understanding as Preparation for Collaboration", "author": [{"author-name": "Warunya Wunnasri", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}, {"author-name": "Jaruwat Pailai", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}, {"author-name": "Yusuke Hayashi", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}, {"author-name": "Tsukasa Hirashima", "affiliation": "Hiroshima University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2018", "publication-year": "2018", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 599-612", "keywords": ["Collaborative learning", "Pair discussion", "Kit-Build concept map", "Shared understanding"], "citation": "Wunnasri W., Pailai J., Hayashi Y., Hirashima T.

However, it is difficult for learners to explain their own understanding elaborately in collaborative learning. In this study, we propose a collaborative use of a Kit-Build concept map (KB map) called \u201cReciprocal KB map\u201d. In a Reciprocal KB map for a pair discussion, at first, the two participants make their own concept maps expressing their comprehension. Then, they exchange the components of their maps and request each other to reconstruct their maps by using the components. The differences between the original concept map and the reconstructed map are diagnosed automatically as an advantage of the KB map. Reciprocal KB map is expected to encourage pair discussion to recognize the understanding of each other and to create an effective discussion. In an experiment reported in this paper, Reciprocal KB map was used for supporting a pair discussion and was compared with a pair discussion which was supported by a traditional concept map. Nineteen pairs of university students were requested to use the traditional concept map in their discussion, while 20 pairs of university students used Reciprocal KB map for discussing the same topic. The results of the experiment were analyzed using three metrics: a discussion score, a similarity score, and questionnaires. The discussion score, which investigates the value of talk in discussion, demonstrates that Reciprocal KB map can promote more effective discussion between the partners compared to the traditional concept map. The similarity score, which evaluates the similarity of the concept maps, demonstrates that Reciprocal KB map can encourage the pair of partners to understand each other better compared to the traditional concept map. Last, the questionnaires illustrate that Reciprocal KB map can support the pair of partners to collaborate in the discussion smoothly and that the participants accepted this method for sharing their understanding with each other. These results suggest that Reciprocal KB map is a promising approach for encouraging pairs of partners to understand each other and to promote the effective discussions.\n"}}, {"name": "978-3-319-93843-1_45.json", "data": {"article-title": "Early Identification of At-Risk Students Using Iterative Logistic Regression", "author": [{"author-name": "Li Zhang", "affiliation": "George Mason University"}, {"author-name": "Huzefa Rangwala", "affiliation": "George Mason University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2018", "publication-year": "2018", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 613-626", "keywords": ["Iterative Logistic Regression", "Educational data mining", "Early dropout prediction"], "citation": "Zhang L., Rangwala H.

The main problem faced with question generation is ensuring that the questions are valid for assessment.

The current study analyzes differences in knowledge decay between learners randomly assigned to an intervention where they could use an adaptive system during a long gap between courses, compared with a control condition. The experimental condition used the Personal Assistant for Life-Long Learning (PAL3), a tablet-based adaptive learning system integrating multiple intelligent tutoring systems and conventional learning resources. It contained electronics content relevant to the experiment participants, Navy sailors who graduated from apprentice electronics courses (A-School) awaiting assignment to their next training (C-School). The study was conducted over one month, collecting performance data with a counterbalanced pre-, mid-, and post-test. The control condition exhibited the expected decay. The PAL3 condition showed a significant difference from the control, with no significant knowledge decay in their overall knowledge, despite substantial variance in usage for PAL3 (e.g., most of overall use in the first week, with fewer participants engaging as time went on). Interestingly, while overall decay was mitigated in PAL3, this result was primarily through gains in some knowledge offsetting losses in other knowledge. Overall, these results indicate that adaptive study tools can help prevent knowledge decay, even with voluntary usage."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-93846-2_24.json", "data": {"article-title": "Computational Thinking Through Game Creation in STEM Classrooms", "author": [{"author-name": "Avery Harrison", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"}, {"author-name": "Taylyn Hulse", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"}, {"author-name": "Daniel Manzo", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"}, {"author-name": "Matthew Micciolo", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"}, {"author-name": "Erin Ottmar", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"}, {"author-name": "Ivon Arroyo", "affiliation": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2018", "publication-year": "2018", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 134-138", "keywords": ["Computational thinking", "Collaborative learning", "STEM"], "citation": "Harrison A., Hulse T., Manzo D., Micciolo M., Ottmar E., Arroyo I.

Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93846-2_31", "abstract": "Boosting engagement with educational software has been promoted as a means of improving student performance. We examine two promising and relatively understudied manipulations from the realm of gambling: the near-win effect and anticipation. The near-win effect occurs when an individual comes close to achieving a goal, while anticipation refers to the build-up of suspense as an outcome is revealed (e.g., losing early vs. late). Gambling psychologists have long studied how near-wins affect engagement in pure-chance games but it is difficult to do the same in an educational context where outcomes are based on skill. We manipulate the display of outcomes such that artificial near-wins are introduced largely independent of a student\u2019s performance. In a study involving thousands of students using an online math tutor, we examine how this manipulation affects a behavioral measure of engagement. We find a near-win effect on engagement when the \u2018win\u2019 indicates to the student that they may continue to the next lesson. Nonetheless, when we experimentally induce near wins in a randomized controlled trial, we do not obtain a reliable effect of the near win. We conclude by describing manipulations that might increase the effect of near wins on engagement."}}, {"name": "978-3-319-93846-2_32.json", "data": {"article-title": "\u201cMind\u201d TS: Testing a Brief Mindfulness Intervention with an Intelligent Tutoring System", "author": [{"author-name": "Kristina Krasich", "affiliation": "University of Notre Dame"}, {"author-name": "Stephen Hutt", "affiliation": "University of Colorado Boulder"}, {"author-name": "Caitlin Mills", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia"}, {"author-name": "Catherine A.

It maintains a personalized ranking over the difficulties of question in the target set and updates it in real-time according to students\u2019 progress.

In this paper, we explore relationships between agent features and student characteristics within a conversation-based assessment of science inquiry skills. We examined the effects of virtual agents\u2019 knowledge status (low vs. high) and language use (comparative vs. argumentative question framing) on agent perceptions (ratings) in a conversation-based assessment of scientific reasoning (i.e., using data to predict the weather).

First, the most straightforward study-choice strategy that metacognitively sophisticated learners can use is to decline to study items that they know they already know. If an item has already been mastered, then further study is unnecessary. All theories, including the RPL model, agree on this strategy, and many, but not all, people use it. Its effective use depends on refined metaknowledge concerning the boundary between what is known and what is not known, as well as the implementation of a rule to decline study of items for which judgments of learning are very high. There are many situations in which people are overconfident, and if they are, they may miss studying items that are almost, but not quite, mastered. These items would yield excellent learning results with just a small amount of study, and so this failure to study almost-learned items has detrimental results. Data will be presented showing that young middle childhood children (7 to 9 year olds) tend not only to be overconfident-thinking they know things when they do not-but also to have an implementation deficit in using metacognitively-based item-choice strategies. One result is that many children at this age fail to use even this most obvious study strategy, even though it will be shown that it would benefit their learning. When the computer implements this learning strategy for the children their later performance improves. Second, with already-learned item eliminated, metacognitively sophisticated learners selectively study the items that are closest to being learned first, before turning to more distal items that will require more time and effort. This, as well as studying the materials that are within their cognitive reach, rather than items that are too difficult, is a strategy that conforms to the so-called \u201cGoldilocks principle\u201d-not too easy and not too difficult but just right. As will be detailed, while college-aged learners use this strategy, older middle childhood children (aged 9-11) do not. Children at this age are not without strategies, however. They do use the strategy of declining the easiest items (including the already-learned items). However, the older middle childhood children overgeneralize this strategy to selectively prefer the most difficult items. While their learning is negatively impacted by this, it is improved if the computer implements the Goldilocks principle on their behalf. Third, people use a stop rule that depends upon a dynamic metacognitive assessment of their own rate of learning. They discontinue study when they perceive that continued efforts are yielding little learning return. This stop rule predicts that people will stop studying easy items when they are fully learned them (and the learning rate has reached an asymptote on ceiling). Study will also stop, however, if the item is too difficult to allow noticeable learning. This strategy keeps people from being trapped in laboring on very difficult items in vain. Finally, the value that each item is assigned on a criterion test, if known during study, influences which items metacognitively sophisticated people choose to study and for how long they continue to study them. Items worth many points on a test will be studied sooner, longer and more often, than items worth few points. But not all learners use these strategies to their advantage. To effectively use the strategies that the Region of Proximal Learning framework indicates are effective, the learners must both have adequate metacognitive knowledge and also exhibit good implementation skills. Both metaknowledge and implementation skills vary across people. Age differences, motivational style differences, and metacognitive expertise differences can result in strategies that vary considerably, and which can result in sizable differences in the effectiveness with which the individual is able obtain his or her learning goals."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_10.json", "data": {"article-title": "Motivational Processes", "author": [{"author-name": "Benedict du Boulay", "affiliation": "University of Sussex"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2011", "publication-year": "2011", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 55-62", "keywords": ["motivation", "pedagogy", "feelings", "expectancies and values"], "citation": "du Boulay B.

We created Monkey\u2019s Revenge, a coordinate geometry learning environment with game \u2013like elements such as narrative, immediate visual feedback, personalization, collecting badges, etc. The tutor basically consists of a series of 8th grade (approximately 13-year olds) coordinate geometry problems wrapped in a visual cover story. In the narrative, Mike, a boy is thrown out of class for playing a game on his cell phone and encounters a monkey and they become friends. He builds a house for the monkey, but the monkey is not eager to become domesticated and destroys the house, steals his phone and runs away. The boy tries to get back his phone by throwing balls to the monkey. To move the story forward, the students have to solve coordinate problems like calculating distance between the boy and the monkey, slope of the roof and walls of the house, finding points where the monkey tied to a rope cannot find bananas and finally figure out slopes, intercepts and equation of the line of the path of the ball. The math content gets more advanced as a student progresses through the story. Students get immediate visual feedback on their response. For example, if a student puts banana at the wrong coordinate, the monkey can reach it and will eat the banana.

It employs a board-game design with a variety of different sub-games, game modes and levels of difficulty. When a student has learnt to play one of the sub-games, she may teach it to her Teachable Agent (TA). In the observation mode the TA \u201cwatches\u201d the student play and picks up on game rules and on the student\u2019s responses to multiple-choice questions, such as \u201cWhy did you choose this card?\u201d Proper (or improper) choices of cards and answers promote corresponding skills in the TA throughout the game. In the try-and-be-guided mode, the agent is allowed to propose cards. The student either accepts the agent\u2019s suggestion or rejects it and exchanges the agent\u2019s card for another one. Again the agent asks for the reasons for the student\u2019s behaviour, using the multiple-choice format. In other words, the basic game with the TA contains a form of on-task conversation between agent and student. But the game architecture also has been extended with a chat where the student can engage in conversation with the TA, writing freely by means of the keyboard and bring up basically any topic in a chat-like manner. We refer to this as off-task conversation and distinguish within it between on-domain conversation and off-domain conversation, the former referring to chat conversation related to school, math, the math game, etc., and the latter to any other topic. One reason to include off-task conversation is to enrich the game and its motivational qualities for the age group in question (12-14 year olds). Another is to be able to explore whether such a conversational module can enable pedagogical interventions, such as supporting pupils math self efficacy and change negative attitudes toward math in general. Notably the on-task and off-task conversations have very different formats, but are still designed as two interrelated and complementary activities. A recent study [1] indicates that the added off-task conversation module can i) improve students\u2019 game experience, ii) improve learning outcomes, and iii) engage learners in voluntary on-domain chat."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_128.json", "data": {"article-title": "Inquire for iPad: A Biology Textbook That Answers Questions", "author": [{"author-name": "Aaron Spaulding", "affiliation": "SRI International"}, {"author-name": "Adam Overholtzer", "affiliation": "SRI International"}, {"author-name": "John Pacheco", "affiliation": "SRI International"}, {"author-name": "Jing Tien", "affiliation": "SRI International"}, {"author-name": "Vinay K.

As of April 8, 2011, over 270 datasets are stored including over 58 million student actions and over 165,000 student hours of data. Most student actions are \u201ccoded\u201d meaning they are not only graded as correct or incorrect, but are categorized in terms of the hypothesized competencies or knowledge components needed to perform that action. DataShop provides repository users a central hub to satisfy long term data management needs. DataShop also has a number of features to facilitate data analysis including a data schema that allows researchers to import data into DataShop or export data from the repository in order to perform additional analysis. DataShop offers a number of online analysis tools to perform functions, such as visualizing student performance and analyzing learning curves. Researchers can export cognitive models, make changes, and upload the changed model for further analysis. One new feature that has been added to DataShop is an easy-to-use API for using web services to access the repository. These web services allow developers to identify data sets in the repository and directly export data from them at the transaction or student step level. In the near future, developers will be able to add new fields back into the repository with the use of our web services for custom fields."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_13.json", "data": {"article-title": "When Does Disengagement Correlate with Learning in Spoken Dialog Computer Tutoring?", "author": [{"author-name": "Kate Forbes-Riley", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh"}, {"author-name": "Diane Litman", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2011", "publication-year": "2011", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 81-89", "keywords": ["types of disengagement", "learning", "correlations", "spoken dialog computer tutors", "manual annotation", "natural language processing"], "citation": "Forbes-Riley K., Litman D.

The purpose of an instructional system is, after all, to supply the cognitive mechanisms in the learner\u2019s mind with the information they need to create new knowledge. It is therefore imperative that the design of instruction is based on explicit models of those mechanisms. From this point of view, research has to date been characterized by two conceptual limitations. The first limitation is that systems are designed to teach to a narrow set of learning mechanisms, sometimes even a single one. There are signs that attempts to build intelligent tutoring systems that address a single mode of learning encounter diminishing returns, in terms of student improvement, with respect to implementation effort. The reason is that people learn in multiple ways. In this talk, I argue that there are approximately nine distinct modes of learning cognitive skills. To be maximally effective, instruction should support all nine modes of learning. This is the way to overcome the diminishing returns of tutoring systems with a narrow bandwidth. The second limitation is the traditional focus in both the science of learning and the practice of instruction on additive or monotonic learning: That is, learning in which the student extends his/her knowledge base without reformulating the knowledge he/she possessed at the outset. Additive extensions of a person\u2019s knowledge are certainly real and important, but they do not exhaust the types of learning of which human beings are capable. In many learning scenarios, the learner must overcome or override the implications of prior knowledge in order to learn successfully. This requires cognitive mechanisms that transform or reject the prior knowledge, in addition to building new knowledge. In this talk, I provide an outline of the essential characteristics of such non-monotonic learning processes. I end the talk by spelling out some implications of the multiple-mechanisms and non-monotonicity principles for the future development of instructional systems."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_20.json", "data": {"article-title": "Short and Long Term Benefits of Enjoyment and Learning within a Serious Game", "author": [{"author-name": "G.

But, it may also encourage students to use error-flagging as an expedient substitute for their own judgment; (2) Given error-flagging support, many more students will arrive at the correct answer by revising their answer, which explains why students score higher with error-flagging; (3) Students will use error-flagging to reach the correct answer through trial and error even though the problems are not of multiple-choice nature.

Secondary knowledge is cultural knowledge that humans have required more recently and have not specifically evolved to acquire. Cognitive load theory applies to secondary rather than primary knowledge. With respect to secondary knowledge, the theory assumes that human cognition constitutes a natural information processing system that has evolved to mimic another natural information processing system, biological evolution, with both systems characterised by the same basic principles. These principles lead directly to the assumption that biologically secondary knowledge consists of a very large range of domain-specific knowledge structures and that the primary aim of instruction is to assist learners in the acquisition of that knowledge.

Given prior findings, together with the prevailing belief that students should be prompted to actively solve problems after studying examples, rarely have all worked examples been tried as a learning intervention. To test the conventional wisdom, as well as to explore an understudied approach, a study was conducted with 145 high school students in the domain of chemistry to compare alternating worked examples / tutored problems, all tutored problems, and all worked examples. It was hypothesized that the alternating condition would lead to better results (i.e., better learning and/or learning efficiency) than either all examples or all tutored problems. However, the hypothesis was not confirmed: While all three conditions learned roughly the same amount, the all worked examples condition took significantly less time and was a more efficient learning treatment than either alternating examples/tutored problems or all tutored problems.

While initial results with Learning Factors Transfer (LiFT) analysis (a search procedure using Performance Factors Analysis, PFA) show that more predictive models can be built by paying attention to these transfer factors [1, 2], like proceeding models such as AFM (Additive Factors Model) [3], these models rely on a Q-matrix analysis that treats skills as discrete units at transfer. Because of this discrete treatment, the models are more parsimonious, but may lose resolution on aspects of component transfer. To improve understanding of this transfer, we develop new logistic regression model variants that predict learning differences as a function of the context of learning. One advantage of these models is that they allow us to disentangle learning of transferable knowledge from the actual transfer performance episodes."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_35.json", "data": {"article-title": "Scenario-Based Training: Director\u2019s Cut", "author": [{"author-name": "Marieke Peeters", "affiliation": ["Utrecht University", "TNO - Human Factors"]}, {"author-name": "Karel van den Bosch", "affiliation": "TNO - Human Factors"}, {"author-name": "John-Jules Ch.

The implications of this study suggest that by using computer tutors for assessment, we can save much instructional time that is currently used for just assessment."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_5.json", "data": {"article-title": "A Comparison of the Effects of Nine Activities within a Self-directed Learning Environment on Skill-Grained Learning", "author": [{"author-name": "Ari Bader-Natal", "affiliation": "Grockit, Inc."}, {"author-name": "Thomas Lotze", "affiliation": "Grockit, Inc."}, {"author-name": "Daniel Furr", "affiliation": "Grockit, Inc."}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2011", "publication-year": "2011", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 15-22", "keywords": ["self-directed learning", "learner control", "skill-grained evaluation"], "citation": "Bader-Natal A., Lotze T., Furr D.

Once these activities are made available to students, researchers can evaluate these activities by analyzing observed usage and performance data by asking: Which of these activities are most engaging? Which are most effective? Answers to these questions enable a system designer to highlight and encourage those activities that are both effective and popular, to refine those that are either effective or popular, and to reconsider or remove those that are neither effective nor popular.

We have developed an automated detector of conceptual content that is used as a basis for providing adaptive prompts to peer tutors in high-school algebra. We conducted an after-school study with 61 participants where we compared this adaptive support to two nonadaptive support conditions, and found that adaptive prompts significantly increased conceptual help and peer tutor domain learning. The amount of conceptual help students gave, as determined by either human coding or machine classification, was predictive of learning.

In the framework of KB map, an ideal concept map (goal map) is prepared by a teacher or an expert at first, and parts are generated by decomposing the goal map. The parts are provided to learners, and then the learners build concept maps (learner maps) by connecting the parts.

We used Keller\u2019s ARCS theoretical model and physiological sensors (heart rate, skin conductance, and electroencephalogram) to record learners\u2019 reactions throughout the game. This paper focused on assessing learners\u2019 attention in situations relevant to learning, namely overcoming errors and obstacles. Statistical analysis has been used for the investigation of relationships between theoretical and empirical variables. Results from non-parametric tests and linear regression supported the hypothesis that physiological patterns and their evolution are suitable tools to directly and reliably assess learners\u2019 attention. Intelligent learning systems can greatly benefit from using these results to enhance and adapt their interventions."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-21869-9_80.json", "data": {"article-title": "Design Dimensions of Intelligent Text Entry Tutors", "author": [{"author-name": "Per Ola Kristensson", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2011", "publication-year": "2011", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 494-496", "keywords": ["Text entry", "intelligent text entry", "text entry tutor", "typing tutor"], "citation": "Kristensson P.O.

This paper investigates posture and gesture in computer-mediated tutorial dialogue using automated techniques to track posture and hand-to-face gestures. Annotated dialogue transcripts were analyzed to identify the relationships between student posture, student gesture, and tutor and student dialogue. The results indicate that posture and hand-to-face gestures are significantly associated with particular tutorial dialogue moves. Additionally, two-hands-to-face gestures occurred significantly more frequently among students with low self-efficacy. The results shed light on the cognitive-affective mechanisms that underlie these nonverbal behaviors. Collectively, the findings provide insight into the interdependencies among tutorial dialogue, posture, and gesture, revealing a new avenue for automated tracking of embodied affect during learning."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-39112-5_10.json", "data": {"article-title": "Identifying Localization in Peer Reviews of Argument Diagrams", "author": [{"author-name": "Huy V.

The Cognitive Tutor was used to test these hypotheses because it offers both JITs, which map onto the tutor-remediation hypothesis, and flag feedback, which maps onto the self-remediation hypothesis. To evaluate the effectiveness of JITs, we conducted a naturalistic experiment where learning from older versions of the software, which did not include specific JITs, was contrasted with a later version that included the JITs.

All students used ASSISTments, an ITS, to do their homework but we ablated all of the intelligent tutoring aspects of hints, feedback messages and mastery learning as appropriate to the two practice conditions. We found that students learned reliably more in the web-based homework condition and with an effect size of 0.56.

However, there are other sources of information that are not utilized, such as the performance on other students in same class. This paper extends the Student-Skill extension of Knowledge Tracing, to take into account the class information, and learns four parameters: prior knowledge, learn, guess and slip for each class of students enrolled in the system. The paper then compares the accuracy using the four parameters for each class versus the four parameters for each student to find out which parameter set works better in predicting student performance. The result shows that modeling at coarser grain sizes can actually result in higher predictive accuracy, and data about classmates\u2019 performance is results in a higher predictive accuracy on unseen test data."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-39112-5_160.json", "data": {"article-title": "The Fourth International Workshop on Culturally-Aware Tutoring Systems", "author": [{"author-name": "Emmanuel G.

The second of these roles has been much explored in AIED, with the development of pedagogical agents [2] that can serve, for example, as learning companions [3] or disturbing agents, or even as tutors. In contrast, there is a paucity of research into either the first or third role for simulated learners. The main research touching on the first role is the development of teachable agents in a reciprocal learning context [4], but this is more of a pedagogical strategy for learners than it is a practice environment for teachers.

However, there is need for more research into what this implies for configuring instruction so that strong semantic network learning is supported with the goal of creating an integrated mental model in the student\u2019s mind. We investigate this question in the context of map learning, where country names are encoded relative to geographic border, internal features, or external features. The main hypothesis was that external features as cues would encourage transfer, since students would practice a network of relationships. The results primarily supported a theory of \u201ccue reinstatement\u201d, where transfer occurred when cues present at learning were present at testing. These effects were analyzed with a mixed effects logistic regression learner model of trial-by-trial learning."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-39112-5_21.json", "data": {"article-title": "Visualising Multiple Data Sources in an Independent Open Learner Model", "author": [{"author-name": "Susan Bull", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham"}, {"author-name": "Matthew D.

Inquiry-based learning environments typically require students to guide their own learning and inquiry processes as they gather data, make and test hypotheses and draw conclusions. Some students are highly self-regulated learners and are able to guide and monitor their own learning activities effectively. Unfortunately, many students lack these skills and are consequently less successful in open-ended, inquiry-based environments. This work examines differences in inquiry behavior patterns in an open-ended, game-based learning environment, Crystal Island. Differential sequence mining is used to identify meaningful behavior patterns utilized by Low, Medium, and High self-regulated learners. Results indicate that self-regulated learners engage in more effective problem solving behaviors and demonstrate different patterns of use of the provided cognitive tools.

To acquire robust knowledge of the domain, students need to make connections between the different graphical representations. In doing so, students need to engage in two crucial learning processes: sense-making processes to build up conceptual understanding of the connections, and fluency-building processes to fast and effortlessly make use of perceptual properties in making connections. We present an experimental study which contrasts two hypotheses on how these learning processes interact. Does understanding facilitate fluency-building processes, or does fluency enhance sense-making processes? And consequently, which learning process should intelligent tutoring systems support first? Our results based on test data and tutor logs show an advantage for providing support for sense-making processes before fluency-building processes.

In this paper we investigate the relationship between a student\u2019s affective state, their tendency to engage in disengaged behavior, and the design aspects of the learning environments, towards understanding the role that affect plays in this process. To investigate this question, we integrate an existing taxonomy of the features of tutor lessons [3] with automated detectors of affect [8]. We find that confusion and frustration are significantly associated with lesson features which were found to be associated with disengaged behavior in past research. At the same time, we find that the affective state of engaged concentration is significantly associated with features associated with lower frequencies of disengaged behavior. This analysis suggests that simple re-designs of tutors along these lines may lead to both better affect and less disengaged behavior."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-39112-5_40.json", "data": {"article-title": "Cluster-Based Prediction of Mathematical Learning Patterns", "author": [{"author-name": "Tanja Ka\u0308ser", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich"}, {"author-name": "Alberto Giovanni Busetto", "affiliation": ["ETH Zurich", "Competence Center for Systems Physiology and Metabolic Diseases"]}, {"author-name": "Barbara Solenthaler", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich"}, {"author-name": "Juliane Kohn", "affiliation": "University of Potsdam"}, {"author-name": "Michael von Aster", "affiliation": ["University Children\u2019s Hospital", "University of Potsdam", "German Red Cross Hospitals Westend"]}, {"author-name": "Markus Gross", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2013", "publication-year": "2013", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 389-399", "keywords": ["feature processing", "pairwise clustering", "prediction", "learning", "dyscalculia"], "citation": "Ka\u0308ser T., Busetto A.G., Solenthaler B., Kohn J., von Aster M., Gross M.

The typical effect sizes achieved by ITSs are around 1SD, which are still low in comparison to the effectiveness of expert human tutors. Recently there have been several analyses done in order to identify the factors that contribute to success of human tutors, and to replicate it in ITSs. VanLehn [6] proposes that the crucial factor is the granularity of interaction: the lower the level of discussions between the (human or artificial) tutor and the student, the higher the effectiveness. We investigated the effect of interaction granularity in the context of NORMIT, a constraint-based tutor that teaches data normalization. Our study compared the standard version of NORMIT, which provided hints in response to errors, to a version which used adaptive tutorial dialogues instead. The results show that the interaction granularity hypothesis holds in our experimental situation, and that the effect size achieved is consistent with other reported studies of a similar nature."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-39112-5_48.json", "data": {"article-title": "Revealing the Learning in Learning Curves", "author": [{"author-name": "R.

This phenomenon appears to be in part a characteristic of mastery learning.

Participants who studied the difficult version of the texts reported significantly higher rates of mind wandering (d = .41) and lower arousal both during (d = .52) and after the learning session (d = .48). Mind wandering and arousal were not affected by choice. However, participants who were assigned to study the topic they selected reported significantly more positive valence during (d = .57) but not after learning.

Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, eighth-grade students\u2019 situational interest and comprehension of texts embedded within a science game-based learning environment will be measured.

The main issue addressed in this paper is how to scaffold learning scenario creation. This paper presents a model of investigative learning, which induces learners to create the learning scenario by decomposing the topic into sub-topics to be learned while searching and learning the Web resources. This paper also demonstrates an interactive learning scenario builder, which provides a scaffold for the learners to build their own scenario in learning with Web resources."}}, {"name": "978-3-642-39112-5_93.json", "data": {"article-title": "Towards Identifying Students\u2019 Causal Reasoning Using Machine Learning", "author": [{"author-name": "Jody Clarke-Midura", "affiliation": "Harvard University"}, {"author-name": "Michael Yudelson", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University"}], "conf-title": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education", "conf-acronym": "AIED 2013", "publication-year": "2013", "book-title": "Artificial Intelligence in Education", "page-info": "pp 704-707", "keywords": ["Virtual learning environment", "performance assessment", "causal reasoning", "machine learning"], "citation": "Clarke-Midura J., Yudelson M.V.

To illustrate our point, we present the results of comparing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based adaptive feedback system to a system that does not utilize NLP capabilities. We show that, while there were no learning gain differences between the two systems, the correlates to gain were different. In the non-NLP system, only student performance during the training was correlated to learning gain. In the adaptive system, more variables correlated with learning, including measures of system capability and student satisfaction.
